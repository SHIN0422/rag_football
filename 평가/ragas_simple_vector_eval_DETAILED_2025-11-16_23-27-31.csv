Whether finding a yard of space when Liverpool were in a low block or racing into space, he was unstoppable.\nCity have picked up the most points of any Premier League team since April and that is something that will not be lost on Mikel Arteta and Arsenal as they feel Guardiola's side on their shoulders now.

The onus is on the wing-back to create the width in that system, while at Arsenal it is the left-winger – in this case Eze - being asked to stay wide.\nPerhaps Eze is taking time to adjust to new surroundings and different tactical instructions. There is every chance that with time he can make the left-wing role at Arsenal his own. His team-mates will no doubt need time and reps on the pitch to adapt to his game, too.\nBut the manner and speed of Martinelli’s impact showed what Arsenal were missing with Eze playing out on the left. It was the pace and surging run of the substitute that opened up Athletic Club’s defence. It felt like the first time Arsenal had got in behind them all night.\nThere is clearly a lot more competition for Eze in central areas than out on the left, but surely there will be a temptation for Arteta to deploy the attacking midfielder as the No 10 sooner or later. For now, the system does not get the best out of Eze as a left-winger."", ""Manchester City have won seven of their opening eight games, and are the first team other than Chelsea to start a matchday as the WSL leaders this far into a season since the penultimate weekend of the 2023/24 campaign.

They keep the ball, pop it around, suffocate teams with possession and eventually the team would have to do something and they would either see out a 1-0 win or they\'d go and win two and three.\n""That\'s not this Manchester City now because that\'s not a clean sheet back four anymore and it\'s giving teams a chance it\'s giving teams encouragement which means it puts pressure on the midfield and the forwards to score two and three.""', ""Arteta's squad has been strengthened in all departments.
