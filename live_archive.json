After being out for 236 days with an anterior cruciate ligament tear, another injury, picked up at the Club World Cup has hampered his return.\n\"But the big news today is that he is back!\n\"As Pep Guardiola pointed out, in a few months, the world will appoint a new Ballon d’Or winner, but for now Rodri holds that accolade and when I asked the manager how much of a boost his return is, he replied that he is \"still the best in the world\".\n\"Rodri’s return, coupled with the City boss revealing that Phil Foden is also fit again, are huge boosts ahead of Spurs on Saturday. Rodri \"needs minutes\", so I’d expect a rousing Etihad reception, perhaps off the bench, for the Spaniard tomorrow.\n\"Guardiola wouldn’t be drawn when I asked him on outgoings - the futures of Manuel Akanji and Savinho remain unknown. As does that of goalkeeper, Ederson.\n\"Guardiola says the goalkeeper is fit again after illness but told me that he will decide at dinner tonight on whether James Trafford will stay in the sticks or whether the Brazilian will return.\n\"Trafford was impressive on his debut for City and his incredible performances for Burnley last season have pushed him into the England frame. Guardiola has a huge call to make, which could have impacts felt as far as next year’s World Cup.\n\"As is typical of the City boss, he was full of praise for a ‘top manager’ in Thomas Frank and was similarly positive about his new assistant, Pep Lijnders.\n\"Jurgen Klopp’s former right-hand man is now Guardiola’s assistant and came into the City backroom as part of a summer refresh together with Liverpool’s James French on set pieces and former City and Arsenal defender, Kolo Toure.\n\"Guardiola, in a pastel yellow hoody looked relaxed and appears refreshed after a difficult season that was put behind them with positive showings at the Club World Cup.\n\"My impression is that the staff, players and the manager have all returned from the USA in a positive place and combined with their 4-0 win at Wolves, it’s fair to say Spurs are in for a tough test tomorrow.\""

The first goal - eight minutes extra time. After the first corner it was already nine minutes. It is time to stop the game. That is the rules.\n\"I asked the referee and he said because we lost time. But I checked the eight minutes. The game didn't stop.\n\"It's very difficult.

        "text": "Sky Sports' Sanny Rudravajhala:\nIt's the question 'every team is asking' Scott Parker told me, when I asked him ‘how do you beat Liverpool?’\nSunday will be arguably Burnley's toughest home game of the entire season. The reigning champions, with all their additions, which now includes Alexander Isak. Oof! The Burnley boss says they'll have to be the 'best version of themselves' for a chance against Arne Slot's side.\nThe Burnley manager also shared his thoughts on VAR after a late penalty call denied them a point at Old Trafford last time out in a 3-2 defeat. Parker's point on the emotion and how we may enjoy a game is one that will resonate with fans in a league that he admits has even changed since he was last in the Premier League with Bournemouth two years ago.\nAs for Turf Moor on Sunday, that's certainly been his happy place. Here's a remarkable stat for you: in his 25 home games in charge at Burnley, he's never experienced defeat. A record Clarets fans will be hoping, almost against hope, that they'll still have by Sunday evening."

The reigning champions, with all their additions, which now includes Alexander Isak. Oof! The Burnley boss says they'll have to be the 'best version of themselves' for a chance against Arne Slot's side.\nThe Burnley manager also shared his thoughts on VAR after a late penalty call denied them a point at Old Trafford last time out in a 3-2 defeat. Parker's point on the emotion and how we may enjoy a game is one that will resonate with fans in a league that he admits has even changed since he was last in the Premier League with Bournemouth two years ago.\nAs for Turf Moor on Sunday, that's certainly been his happy place. Here's a remarkable stat for you: in his 25 home games in charge at Burnley, he's never experienced defeat. A record Clarets fans will be hoping, almost against hope, that they'll still have by Sunday evening."

        "text": "Pep Guardiola\nheaped praise on former\nMan City\nright-back\nKyle Walker\nahead of the pair's first reunion when his new side\nBurnley\nvisit the Etihad on Saturday.\nWalker left the club in the summer after eight years in Manchester, joining the club at the end of Guardiola's first season - long enough to receive medals from all 15 major honours won under the current boss.\nThe 35-year-old fell out of favour in his final season at the club and spent the second half of the campaign on loan at AC Milan before joining Burnley.\nBut Guardiola said he still remembers England defender as one of the game's all-time greats in his position.\n\"I'm pretty sure everybody will be happy to see him,\" he said.\n\"It was an unbelievable few years for us and he was the right-back who defined our time here in the last nine or 10 years. I'm pretty sure he will get the gratitude of our fans.\n\"Absolutely he deserves it. [He is] one of the greatest full-backs ever. In terms of his consistency, no injuries, an incredible figure in the dressing room.\n\"In eight years, six Premier Leagues, a Champions League, always being there in the good moments and the bad moments.\n\"Of course, the last season was tough for everyone, for him and all of us, but I don't want to judge one behaviour for a short period of time. He was unbelievable.\n\"When you have to control that side with a winger, I slept like a baby before a game with Kyle there. He can handle top-class wingers, he could handle it.\n\"He was a better player on the ball than maybe he could think. My target when he came in was to tell him that. The quality of his long balls, his passing - an incredible right-back for us.\""

        "text": "Burnley head coach Scott Parker to Sky Sports:\n\"Performance-wise, I was with us delighted for 60 to 70 minutes. They showed every bit from what I wanted us from this game. We were right in the game, of course you're up against a colossus club with world class talent. We had to suffer at times, but we also needed to be brave and courageous today and showed our quality, we did that for a large part of it.\n\"Two goals come back to back that put a massive dent in us and the game goes away from us a bit. I don't think the scoreline really reflects that, there were massive positives for us from the first part of that game.\n\"My feeling watching that game, looking at my team, is we played very, very well. The back end there are bits that are disappointing. I understand that, because you're playing against a team where the game can quickly move away from you.\n\"You can come to Man City and get beat comfortably, I've seen world class teams have those problems. We take the positives from today and understand the moments we can improve, we keep going.\""
