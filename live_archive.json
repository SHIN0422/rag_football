        "text": "Sky Sports News' Sanny Rudravajhala:\n\"Rodri was on crutches when he arrived to collect the Ballon d’Or back in October. After being out for 236 days with an anterior cruciate ligament tear, another injury, picked up at the Club World Cup has hampered his return.\n\"But the big news today is that he is back!\n\"As Pep Guardiola pointed out, in a few months, the world will appoint a new Ballon d’Or winner, but for now Rodri holds that accolade and when I asked the manager how much of a boost his return is, he replied that he is \"still the best in the world\".\n\"Rodri’s return, coupled with the City boss revealing that Phil Foden is also fit again, are huge boosts ahead of Spurs on Saturday. Rodri \"needs minutes\", so I’d expect a rousing Etihad reception, perhaps off the bench, for the Spaniard tomorrow.\n\"Guardiola wouldn’t be drawn when I asked him on outgoings - the futures of Manuel Akanji and Savinho remain unknown. As does that of goalkeeper, Ederson.\n\"Guardiola says the goalkeeper is fit again after illness but told me that he will decide at dinner tonight on whether James Trafford will stay in the sticks or whether the Brazilian will return.\n\"Trafford was impressive on his debut for City and his incredible performances for Burnley last season have pushed him into the England frame. Guardiola has a huge call to make, which could have impacts felt as far as next year’s World Cup.\n\"As is typical of the City boss, he was full of praise for a ‘top manager’ in Thomas Frank and was similarly positive about his new assistant, Pep Lijnders.\n\"Jurgen Klopp’s former right-hand man is now Guardiola’s assistant and came into the City backroom as part of a summer refresh together with Liverpool’s James French on set pieces and former City and Arsenal defender, Kolo Toure.\n\"Guardiola, in a pastel yellow hoody looked relaxed and appears refreshed after a difficult season that was put behind them with positive showings at the Club World Cup.\n\"My impression is that the staff, players and the manager have all returned from the USA in a positive place and combined with their 4-0 win at Wolves, it’s fair to say Spurs are in for a tough test tomorrow.\""

I never talk with him about it. He's our player. When I watch him on the training, he's committed with everybody, committed with the team. He's a fighter. He likes to win. He's preparing himself to play tomorrow.”\nAsked if Wolves could afford to lose a key player between now and the end of the transfer window, Pereira added: “I don't know. The market is the market. If the window is open, the players can come and the players can leave. I believe this is possible.”"
