I've not got any defenders. I'm very limited to what I can choose defensive-wise.\n\"It already has changed a lot of my plans because, obviously, we're without Jarrad and we have been without Myko for, certainly, the first couple of games.\n\"We had this at the end of last season as well, we've had it all through the summer. It's not as if we've necessarily got it better.\n\"We've got people back, but others are injured.

Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.\nBut it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.\nAsked about Grealish’s improvement, David Moyes said: “Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.” He added: “The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.”"

Given his lack of football over the past 12 months and only now making his Pumas debut it was unlikely that Ramsey would be able to start and, given in the September international window Wales only have one competitive match, why make Ramsey travel from Mexico to Kazakhstan via Cardiff for a game he could at best have a limited impact on?\nThe large distances to travel and time on a plane would only add the risk of fatigue. For Wales it might be better for him to remain in Mexico to train and play with important qualifying fixtures coming up against Belgium in October, and Liechtenstein and North Macedonia in November.\nIt's highly unlikely Ramsey's Wales career is over. Bellamy is not a coach who will close the door on any player. He is pragmatic when it comes to Wales selection, leaning on experienced players like Ramsey, but also promoting young players into the senior squad.\nFor this camp Bellamy has included three uncapped players in\nKai Andrews\n,\nRonan Kpakio\nand\nDylan Lawlor\n, but the absence of Leeds captain\nEthan Ampadu\nthrough injury will be a blow. for Bellamy.\nThe 24 year old picked up a knee injury during Leeds 1-0 win over Everton earlier this month.\nWales play Kazakhstan on September 4 in a Group J World Cup Qualifier, followed by a friendly against Canada in Swansea on September 9."

I will expect to go to my house tonight and then tomorrow go to work and then continue as normal. It’s not in my hands to make a decision.\n\"And until the very last moment, I will just do my best and try to do my things. When the situation is not in my control, I don’t think too much about what is going to happen in the future. Because realistically, I do as much as I can.\n\"At least if I go out, whether that’s tomorrow or if it’s in three years, I will always go out with the feeling that I made the decisions that I want to make. Obviously that includes my mistakes, but my decisions were honest and what I thought was the correct thing to do in every single moment.”\nSelles, who previously managed Reading during the Royals’ off-the-field struggles and transfer embargoes, added: “I have been in worse situations and I end up just making the things happen and changing totally around the dynamics.\n\"So I don’t have a doubt about it. I’ve been in situations where I haven’t been paid on time, situations when they get points deductions, situations where we didn’t know if we would be able to train the next day at the training ground.\n\"And the reality is that we turned things around at the moment of connection. But you need to work hard to go to that moment and you need to go through a couple of critical moments on that journey.\""

Today, I don't think we hit the level we should.”\nOn his first league loss as Spurs boss, he said: “I think we clearly didn't perform well today.\n“We knew exactly what they came with, and we trained for it, but we just didn't handle it well enough in terms of the balls behind and the second ball, and the duels in the middle of the park - that's the defensive side of it.\n“On the offensive side, we struggled to find a good enough solution to get through phase one and two, so we could get up there and put a bit of pressure on them.\n\"We only did that in the last 15, where we put good pressure and we could have equalised, but I think over the game it was fair that Bournemouth won.”\nDominic Solanke\nwas absent for the loss with a minor ankle injury.\nFrank is hopeful he will be back after the international break.\nHe said of the ankle issue: “It's not like he re-injured it again. You can say that if you have a muscle injury, then you can maybe re-injure it. It's nothing to do with that.\n“It's just not progressing as quick as we hoped for. But we are still positive that it can be solved in the next two weeks.”\nAsked whether Solanke’s injury would force him to sign another striker in the final days of the transfer window, he replied: “No, but I will not say not particularly.\n\"I think to have three strikers in the squad can cause a problem. They can only play one at a time.\n“So there's a fine balance. I'm not saying we will never go for another striker another time, but I think I'm happy with Dom and Richie.”"

We got imbalanced, made mistakes and West Ham punished us.\n\"I think we were always in control, but no urgency. We were not able to really, really create chances. There was lack of mobility, movement and we played the way West Ham wanted us to play.\n\"They were well-organised. We have to know what they did and now look at ourselves because we made mistakes that really punished us and took us away the game.\n\"This is what we are going to do internally, look so it doesn't repeat again.\n\"Naturally, I think we all need to know each other better.\n\"Today was a bad day, but we bounce back.\""

Today was really positive. But we have to learn quickly - that is the request of this league.\""

They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.\nThe deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate."

Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.\nAsked for an injury update, Amorim said:\n\"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.”\nAmorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing\nBenjamin Sesko\nstarted from the bench.\nSesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.\n\"Everything is connected,\" Amorim said.\n\"So he finished the game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.\n\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.\n\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.\n\"With the problem with Mason Mount, I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes.\n\"So everything was connected.\""

        "text": "Speaking on his\nSky Sports\npodcast, Gary Neville says Man Utd need to sign a new goalkeeper.\nUnited are linked with a deadline day move for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez, as well as Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.\n\"It's just really clear that Manchester United need to bring a goalkeeper in,\" said Neville.\n\"They weren't brilliant yesterday night but I thought they should have been 2-0 or 3-0 up at half time. They missed some big chances. I thought they were far better than Burnley.\n\"But you know going in at 1-0 that Burnley are going to come and have a period and obviously then you end up with a nervy second half because there's just an anxiousness around United at this moment in time and you know late on it was a big relief.\n\"But a much-needed win doesn't clear the clouds completely. I think they'll come back in a couple of weeks, there are big games against City and against Chelsea coming up in the Premier League.\n\"[Saturday] was a good moment for [Ruben Amorim] in the end but it's bloody hard work winning football matches like that and if your goalkeeper is making mistakes it undermines everything that you do.\n\"That ground is the most unforgiving for goalkeepers. The fans get behind managers, the fans get behind all the players but I've said it before about the Manchester United goalkeeper spot and I'll say it again: the toughest position in English football bar none.\n\"If you give goals away at United and you're a goalkeeper you'll get scrutinized heavily. Centre forward is just behind it.\n\"You have to have a goalkeeper that's got a massive personality and character and it's not about the fact that they won't make a mistake. A Manchester United goalkeeper, a Liverpool goalkeeper, any goalkeeper will make mistakes. It's how you make mistakes, how you recover from them, how you look in your body language and how you look authoritative.\n\"I have to say the two that they've got are not going to feel that so they have to get a goalkeeper in my mind I thought it for a number of months. Every United fan thinks it.\n\"The midfield is equally as big a problem by the way but I think that that's going to be too much of an ask but that's a big problem in midfield as well. There's holes in there like you wouldn't believe.\""

You can have the best players in the world, but if it doesn’t gel, you don’t have the chemistry. When Liverpool were at their best, it was Mane, Salah and Firmino. Firmino would drop off, Salah would make those runs in, and Mane too, there was chemistry.\n\"For me, Firmino wasn’t a £125m player, but he made it all tick.

It's been a disappointing start to the season, but as I've said, it doesn't define our season.\n\"Just like today, we're going to enjoy it, but we don't get ahead of ourselves. So for us, we knew we could come here and do that.\n\"We had a feeling about us that the lads' application, the effort, every day in training. I see it every day.\n\"There are only so many times that you do the right things on the pitch and you get your due rewards. Today is the perfect example of that.\n\"We had a stat that we conceded 11 shots and conceded 11 goals [in the first three in all competitions]. That shouldn't happen.\n\"When that happens, we have to look at ourselves and keep the ball out of the back of the net.\n\"Football is very simple: keep the ball out of your net and put it in the back of the other. That's what we did today.\""

        "text": "Analysis from Sky Sports News' Sanny Rudravajhala:\n\"Well, what a move this would be for Manchester City. On the surface, bringing in one of the best goalkeepers in the world would be a boost for any club.\n\"At City, though, it raises several questions. We understand it would allow Ederson to move on, with Fenerbahçe emerging as a strong possibility. But what would this mean for James Trafford?\n\"Learning from Donnarumma would benefit any goalkeeper. At just 26, the Italian already has a decade of first-team experience, and still has many years ahead of him.\n\"Trafford, who returned to City for £31m in the summer, could make his England debut during the international break. However, he has endured a mixed start, with costly mistakes in the defeat to Spurs and in the loss at Brighton on Sunday.\n\"Ederson, now in his ninth season at the club, looks likely to leave.

        "text": "Analysis from Sky Sports News' Sanny Rudravajhala:\n\"Well, what a move this would be for Manchester City. On the surface, bringing in one of the best goalkeepers in the world would be a boost for any club.\n\"At City, though, it raises several questions. We understand it would allow Ederson to move on, with Fenerbahçe emerging as a strong possibility. But what would this mean for James Trafford?\n\"Learning from Donnarumma would benefit any goalkeeper. At just 26, the Italian already has a decade of first-team experience, and still has many years ahead of him.\n\"Trafford, who returned to City for £31m in the summer, could make his England debut during the international break. However, he has endured a mixed start, with costly mistakes in the defeat to Spurs and in the loss at Brighton on Sunday.\n\"Ederson, now in his ninth season at the club, looks likely to leave. But how would Donnarumma fit into Pep Guardiola’s system? We saw with Joe Hart’s replacement by Claudio Bravo that Guardiola prefers ball-playing goalkeepers. Donnarumma doesn’t quite fit that mould.

You can have the best players in the world, but if it doesn’t gel, you don’t have the chemistry. When Liverpool were at their best, it was Mane, Salah and Firmino. Firmino would drop off, Salah would make those runs in, and Mane too, there was chemistry.\n\"For me, Firmino wasn’t a £125m player, but he made it all tick.

They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.\nThe deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate."

The first goal - eight minutes extra time. After the first corner it was already nine minutes. It is time to stop the game. That is the rules.\n\"I asked the referee and he said because we lost time. But I checked the eight minutes. The game didn't stop.\n\"It's very difficult. I make mistakes, the referee makes mistakes, but when it is black or white, we cannot see something that is not there.\nWhen asked if he had spoken to the match officials after the game, Silva added: \"No, I did not speak with him.

Being the manager, you're always hopeful.\n\"You think that you can add maybe one more that can make a difference, but there's no guarantee on that. We'll keep working to the end of the window.\n\"We're really pleased with what we've done so far. I genuinely feel we're a lot stronger squad-wise than we were last year.\n\"We've had an issue at the top end of the pitch [at the start of this season] so fingers crossed we might be able to do some more.\"\nNewcastle announced new signing\nNick Woltemade\nbefore Saturday's draw at Leeds, and Howe gave an insight into his new striker.\n\"He's a really good technician. His size will be a talking point because he's obviously a big presence, but he's not really a target man, although he can head the ball.\n\"It's his creativity around the box. It's his link play. He dribbles with the ball really well for someone so big and he's got real creativity around the box. He will find passes that not many other players can see.\n\"He can add a dimension that we currently don't have and it will lift confidence because when you feel you have goalscorers in your team,  the general level of your whole squad goes up.\n\"You've got to have lots of strings to your bow to be successful in England and he has them. I'm really looking forward to seeing him play in our team.\""

We have to do better with what we have, but when you lose the quality of players that we have from last season to this, Anthony Gordon is a big miss and Joelinton.

        "text": "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire on Sky Sports:\n“Yes, the [Isak] deal is feasible for Liverpool. Part of the reason is that when you sign a player, you spread the cost over the length of the contract.\n\"The players coming in are usually on five-year contracts. So, if you take £500m and divide it by five, that works out at £100m per year in what we call amortisation in the accounts.\n\"Liverpool have also done really well this season in terms of outgoing transfers. Diaz and Nunez have been sold, along with some academy players, and that income counts as pure profit.\n\"Liverpool, who always operate a smart financial system and are never in danger of PSR issues, therefore have plenty of capacity to spend money this summer.”"

The problem is Liverpool haven’t played well,  yet they’ve beaten Newcastle and Arsenal. That’s the issue: they’ve not been at their best, but they’ve still got those results.\n\"It all depends on whether it works. You can have the best players in the world, but if it doesn’t gel, you don’t have the chemistry. When Liverpool were at their best, it was Mane, Salah and Firmino. Firmino would drop off, Salah would make those runs in, and Mane too, there was chemistry.\n\"For me, Firmino wasn’t a £125 million player, but he made it all tick. Unless this new set-up gels, time will tell. What Slot has now is a lot of head-scratching, because he’s got big decisions to make with very good players.\""

Sometimes he might come across as arrogant but it's purely the steely persona that a goalkeeper must develop and the City boss admitted that the England man had reflected on his difficult performance in their 2-0 defeat against Sours.\n\"City 'always' put their arms around their players shoulders, Guardiola told us.\n\"Trafford is in Thomas Tuchel's England squad and Rodri has been recalled for Spain, despite only just coming back from injury, but his club boss says he's happy for Luis de la Fuente to give his midfielder minutes, so long as he comes back in one piece.\n\"On transfers, I was given short shrift. The window closes at 7pm on Monday but it sounds like Savinho will be staying.\n\"Brighton provides another test on Sunday. I don't think we'll see City back to their best just yet and whilst they get up to speed, there's every chance of an upset at the Amex on the weekend.\""

On the surface, bringing in one of the best goalkeepers in the world would be a boost for any club.\n\"At City, though, it raises several questions. We understand it would allow Ederson to move on, with Fenerbahçe emerging as a strong possibility. But what would this mean for James Trafford?\n\"Learning from Donnarumma would benefit any goalkeeper. At just 26, the Italian already has a decade of first-team experience, and still has many years ahead of him.\n\"Trafford, who returned to City for £31m in the summer, could make his England debut during the international break. However, he has endured a mixed start, with costly mistakes in the defeat to Spurs and in the loss at Brighton on Sunday.\n\"Ederson, now in his ninth season at the club, looks likely to leave. But how would Donnarumma fit into Pep Guardiola’s system? We saw with Joe Hart’s replacement by Claudio Bravo that Guardiola prefers ball-playing goalkeepers. Donnarumma doesn’t quite fit that mould. He has also faced criticism for struggling with crosses and set pieces. On those fronts, could Trafford be the better option?\nStill, it would be hard for City to turn down the chance to sign a Champions League winner, no matter what the repercussions might be.\""

        "text": "Speaking on his\nSky Sports\npodcast, Gary Neville says Man Utd need to sign a new goalkeeper.\nUnited are linked with a deadline day move for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez, as well as Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.\n\"It's just really clear that Manchester United need to bring a goalkeeper in,\" said Neville.\n\"They weren't brilliant yesterday night but I thought they should have been 2-0 or 3-0 up at half time. They missed some big chances. I thought they were far better than Burnley.\n\"But you know going in at 1-0 that Burnley are going to come and have a period and obviously then you end up with a nervy second half because there's just an anxiousness around United at this moment in time and you know late on it was a big relief.\n\"But a much-needed win doesn't clear the clouds completely. I think they'll come back in a couple of weeks, there are big games against City and against Chelsea coming up in the Premier League.\n\"[Saturday] was a good moment for [Ruben Amorim] in the end but it's bloody hard work winning football matches like that and if your goalkeeper is making mistakes it undermines everything that you do.\n\"That ground is the most unforgiving for goalkeepers. The fans get behind managers, the fans get behind all the players but I've said it before about the Manchester United goalkeeper spot and I'll say it again: the toughest position in English football bar none.\n\"If you give goals away at United and you're a goalkeeper you'll get scrutinized heavily. Centre forward is just behind it.\n\"You have to have a goalkeeper that's got a massive personality and character and it's not about the fact that they won't make a mistake. A Manchester United goalkeeper, a Liverpool goalkeeper, any goalkeeper will make mistakes. It's how you make mistakes, how you recover from them, how you look in your body language and how you look authoritative.\n\"I have to say the two that they've got are not going to feel that so they have to get a goalkeeper in my mind I thought it for a number of months. Every United fan thinks it.\n\"The midfield is equally as big a problem by the way but I think that that's going to be too much of an ask but that's a big problem in midfield as well. There's holes in there like you wouldn't believe.\""

        "text": "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire on Sky Sports:\n“Yes, the [Isak] deal is feasible for Liverpool. Part of the reason is that when you sign a player, you spread the cost over the length of the contract.\n\"The players coming in are usually on five-year contracts. So, if you take £500m and divide it by five, that works out at £100m per year in what we call amortisation in the accounts.\n\"Liverpool have also done really well this season in terms of outgoing transfers. Diaz and Nunez have been sold, along with some academy players, and that income counts as pure profit.\n\"Liverpool, who always operate a smart financial system and are never in danger of PSR issues, therefore have plenty of capacity to spend money this summer.”"
