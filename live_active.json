Given his lack of football over the past 12 months and only now making his Pumas debut it was unlikely that Ramsey would be able to start and, given in the September international window Wales only have one competitive match, why make Ramsey travel from Mexico to Kazakhstan via Cardiff for a game he could at best have a limited impact on?\nThe large distances to travel and time on a plane would only add the risk of fatigue. For Wales it might be better for him to remain in Mexico to train and play with important qualifying fixtures coming up against Belgium in October, and Liechtenstein and North Macedonia in November.\nIt's highly unlikely Ramsey's Wales career is over. Bellamy is not a coach who will close the door on any player. He is pragmatic when it comes to Wales selection, leaning on experienced players like Ramsey, but also promoting young players into the senior squad.\nFor this camp Bellamy has included three uncapped players in\nKai Andrews\n,\nRonan Kpakio\nand\nDylan Lawlor\n, but the absence of Leeds captain\nEthan Ampadu\nthrough injury will be a blow. for Bellamy.\nThe 24 year old picked up a knee injury during Leeds 1-0 win over Everton earlier this month.\nWales play Kazakhstan on September 4 in a Group J World Cup Qualifier, followed by a friendly against Canada in Swansea on September 9."

I will expect to go to my house tonight and then tomorrow go to work and then continue as normal. It’s not in my hands to make a decision.\n\"And until the very last moment, I will just do my best and try to do my things. When the situation is not in my control, I don’t think too much about what is going to happen in the future. Because realistically, I do as much as I can.\n\"At least if I go out, whether that’s tomorrow or if it’s in three years, I will always go out with the feeling that I made the decisions that I want to make. Obviously that includes my mistakes, but my decisions were honest and what I thought was the correct thing to do in every single moment.”\nSelles, who previously managed Reading during the Royals’ off-the-field struggles and transfer embargoes, added: “I have been in worse situations and I end up just making the things happen and changing totally around the dynamics.\n\"So I don’t have a doubt about it. I’ve been in situations where I haven’t been paid on time, situations when they get points deductions, situations where we didn’t know if we would be able to train the next day at the training ground.\n\"And the reality is that we turned things around at the moment of connection. But you need to work hard to go to that moment and you need to go through a couple of critical moments on that journey.\""

Today, I don't think we hit the level we should.”\nOn his first league loss as Spurs boss, he said: “I think we clearly didn't perform well today.\n“We knew exactly what they came with, and we trained for it, but we just didn't handle it well enough in terms of the balls behind and the second ball, and the duels in the middle of the park - that's the defensive side of it.\n“On the offensive side, we struggled to find a good enough solution to get through phase one and two, so we could get up there and put a bit of pressure on them.\n\"We only did that in the last 15, where we put good pressure and we could have equalised, but I think over the game it was fair that Bournemouth won.”\nDominic Solanke\nwas absent for the loss with a minor ankle injury.\nFrank is hopeful he will be back after the international break.\nHe said of the ankle issue: “It's not like he re-injured it again.

But we are still positive that it can be solved in the next two weeks.”\nAsked whether Solanke’s injury would force him to sign another striker in the final days of the transfer window, he replied: “No, but I will not say not particularly.\n\"I think to have three strikers in the squad can cause a problem. They can only play one at a time.\n“So there's a fine balance. I'm not saying we will never go for another striker another time, but I think I'm happy with Dom and Richie.”"

They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.\nThe deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate."

Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.\nAsked for an injury update, Amorim said:\n\"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.”\nAmorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing\nBenjamin Sesko\nstarted from the bench.\nSesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.\n\"Everything is connected,\" Amorim said.\n\"So he finished the game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.\n\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.\n\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.\n\"With the problem with Mason Mount, I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes.\n\"So everything was connected.\""
