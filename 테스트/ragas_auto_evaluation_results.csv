### 최근 경기 스탯
Simons는 경기에서 높은 활동량을 보여주며, 공수에서 모두 기여하는 능력을 발휘하고 있습니다. 특출난 통계는 없지만, 그의 전반적인 경기력과 팀 내 역할에서 조금씩 나아가고 있다는 평가가 있습니다.

### 장점과 단점
- **장점**: Simons는 공을 소유하지 않을 때의 작업이나 고강도 플레이에서 능력을 보여줍니다. 이는 팀이 전체적으로 효율적인 시스템을 갖추고 있을 때 큰 자산이 됩니다.
- **단점**: 아직 '총체적 선수'로의 완성을 위해 더 많은 개선이 필요하다는 언급이 있습니다. 즉, 완벽한 기량을 갖추기 위해서는 경험과 기술적인 발전이 더 필요할 것으로 보입니다.

### 전문가 및 언론의 평가
전문가들은 Simons가 훈련에서 좋은 모습을 지속적으로 보이고 있으며, 팀의 리더가 되고자 하는 의지를 표현하고 있다고 전하고 있습니다. 한 언론에서는 그가 팀을 이끌고 팀의 경기력 향상에 기여할 가능성이 높다고 평가しています.
