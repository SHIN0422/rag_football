        "title": "Xavi Simons to Tottenham: RB Leipzig goals and assists show pedigree - Spurs might need to build the team around him",
        "content": "Xavi Simons moving to Tottenham represents an exciting addition to the Premier League. This is a player long regarded as one of the top young talents in Europe – and he showed glimpses of that ability despite it being a more difficult season for RB Leipzig.\nThere are those top-line numbers. Ten goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga, even as Leipzig missed out on Europe for the first time since their elevation to the top division. He ranked in the top 10 for goals from open play and big chances created.\nBut it was another statistic, the fact that Simons also ranked among the top 10 players for possession won in the final third, that really cuts to the heart of what can make him so good. The scatter charts below highlights just what a rare combination that this is.\nIt is why Simons remains so attractive. Thomas Frank and Tottenham have been eyeing a No 10 all summer, pursuing Morgan Gibbs-White even before James Maddison suffered a serious injury. They have energy in midfield but combining that with craft is the key.\nThere are some gifted players around, individuals able to provide that spark, but finding those capable of doing the work out of possession, playing at high intensity, is difficult. They are at a premium. Simons has demonstrated that ability from the outset.\nJavier Rabanal, his coach at PSV, did not know what to expect when a teenage Simons turned up in Eindhoven on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. Despite his reputation as a child prodigy, he had made only a handful of senior appearance for the French club.\n\"Nobody really knew ,\" Rabanal tells Sky Sports . \"But what surprised us, at first, was his capacity to defend, to press after the ball was lost. He was really aggressive going after ever lost ball. He wanted to be the first to press, to really put all his energy into it.\"\n\nRabanal attributes that to Simons' background - and it is a cosmopolitan one. A Netherlands international, partly of Surinamese descent, he moved to Spain as a child and was part of Barcelona's famed La Masia academy long before he was a teenager.\nHe was eventually snaffled away from Catalonia by PSG but those principles of pressing were already ingrained. \"This is something that is really appreciated at Barca,\" explains Rabanal. \"He was so aggressive. Everybody recognised him as a potential top talent.\"\nThat season at PSV was pivotal in his career, leading to him winning his first caps for the Netherlands. Rabanal recalls the 2022 Johan Cruyff Shield game against Ajax in front of 52,000 in Amsterdam when he scored to seal a 5-3 win. \"He was really dynamic.\"\nRabanal, assistant coach to Ruud van Nistelrooy that season, adds: \"It was against Go Ahead Eagles away that he scored two goals [in a 5-2 win] and after that he started playing. He was in the team all season, as a winger or inside as a No 8 or a No 10.\"\nThere was an assist for Fabio Silva \"with the outside of the foot\" that stood out as particularly special. Then there was the final game of the season away to AZ Alkmaar when PSV needed a result to be sure of qualifying for next season's Champions League.\n\"Xavi scored twice even, the second of them when we already playing with 10 players. That goal showed what he was all about because he could have gone down but he preferred to score than fall.\" He got his goal to finish as joint-top scorer in the Eredivisie.\nSuch performances earned him a loan move to Leipzig, where he scored eight goals in his debut season and impressed enough for the German club to make him their club-record signing midway through the last campaign, even as the team was faltering.\nSpeaking to Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's sporting director, he described Simons as \"one of the best players in Europe\" and it was easy to see why the player saw it as the right move at the time. Leipzig have a reputation for a high-intensity brand of football.\n\"He was very clear about his personal career plan.\" Ironically, paying a fee for Simons that could have risen north of €80m with performance-related add-ons was a deviation from Leipzig's long-held strategy. They overstretched and it changed Simons' plan.\nThe result is that even at 22 this is a player whose own ambitions can no longer be matched by Leipzig - and this is where the opportunity comes for club and the player. Spurs offer Champions League football. He offers creativity in the final third.\nHe has already shown his quality in different environments and in different positions. On the pitch, he is an asset in and out of possession, a scorer and a creator. \"He scores goals but he is not selfish,\" says Rabanal. \"If he has the chance, he wants assists too.\"\nOff the pitch, his desire to leave Leipzig is unlikely to raise too many alarms at Tottenham. \"He is a really professional worker, doing the extra work in the gym, the extra work with his own physiotherapist,\" adds Rabanal. \"He is always focused on playing football.\"\nIf there was a concern at Chelsea, it was that Simons is a talent who benefits from the team being built around him and that would not be possible with Cole Palmer around. At Tottenham, there is a vacancy for a match-winner. Xavi Simons could be that man.",

        "title": "Alejandro Garnacho transfer news: Chelsea close to agreeing deal to sign Manchester United winger",
        "content": "Chelsea are close to agreeing a deal with Manchester United over the signing of Alejandro Garnacho.\nA compromise over Garnacho's valuation is set to be reached. United valued him at £50m - which was more than what Chelsea were prepared to pay.\nThere is increased confidence that a deal can be completed before Monday's Deadline Day.\nGarnacho has turned down offers from other clubs because he wants to move to Chelsea.\nThe winger was told he could leave United at the end of last season and he is not training with their first-team squad.\nSpeaking earlier this summer, United boss Ruben Amorim felt Garnacho is still a talented player but says things have not worked out for the 21-year-old academy graduate at Old Trafford.\n\"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out,\" said Amorim during United's tour of the USA for the Premier League Summer Series .\n\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.\n\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"\nAmorim also revealed that sales this summer are important because he wants a smaller squad this season, given United are not in Europe and will only fight on three fronts.\n\"I'm really happy with the team,\" said Amorim. \"Without European competitions, I want a small squad so everyone feels really important.\n\"If you have a lot of players, you have one week to prepare and a lot of players are going to be out, and then in training they will be frustrated and then the quality of the training will drop.\"\n\nMan Utd are expecting offers for midfielder Kobbie Mainoo amid growing interest from home and in Europe.\nThe 20-year-old is understood to be open to leaving, but has not transmitted that stance to the club yet.\nMainoo was an unused substitute in United's opening two Premier League games. United are happy with Mainoo and are not actively looking to let him go - and at this stage, they are very unlikely to consider a loan.\nNapoli will hold more talks with United as they look to finalise a deal for striker Rasmus Hojlund .\n\nTwo other clubs - one from England and one from Germany - made late enquiries for Hojlund. But he wants to go to Napoli. He is ready to travel to Naples once the clubs can agree on the move.\nUnited will do a deal, but on their terms. Both United and Hojlund want a guaranteed permanent element included in any deal.\nNapoli's initial proposal was a loan with an option - the option would become mandatory depending on certain conditions being met based on appearances, goals and Champions League qualification.\nDiscussions between Real Betis and United over Antony have been described as positive and there is a cautious optimism a deal will finally be struck.\nAfter spending the entire window trying to do a straight loan, Betis are working on a deal that will have a mandatory element attached, be that an initial loan or a straight permanent deal.\nUnited have made it clear from the outset that they will not accept another loan move. There is a strong will from all parties to strike a deal before Deadline Day.\nWinger Jadon Sancho is exploring his options. A number of clubs are interested in the 25-year-old. Roma are desperate to sign him, but, as it stands, he doesn't want to go to the Serie A side.\n\nUnited's preference is a permanent deal. However, with just five days to go, another loan cannot be ruled out. Sancho has entered the final year of his contract - United have the option to extend for a further 12 months.\nInterest from clubs in Europe is growing in United defender Tyrell Malacia . At this stage, a loan move is the most likely outcome. Malacia has entered the final year of his contract.\nMainoo , meanwhile, is not a Chelsea target. The Blues asked about him in January but they have since moved on.\nFermin Lopez is a player who has been on Chelsea's radar for a long time and they are prepared to make a move if they were to receive any encouragement from Barcelona or the attacking midfielder.\nMeanwhile, Nicolas Jackson will only be allowed to leave Chelsea in a permanent move or a loan plus an obligation to buy.\nBayern Munich and Aston Villa want Jackson and there are expected to be more developments when Alexander Isak's future at Newcastle United is resolved.\nJuventus have registered their interest in Jackson, but they are currently pressing ahead with trying to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain instead.\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Antoine Semenyo: Man arrested following alleged racist abuse towards Bournemouth forward during Premier League opener at Liverpool",
        "content": "A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been arrested after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused during the first game of the Premier League season, Merseyside Police said.\nThe force said the man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence and has been taken into custody to be interviewed.\nSemenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator to referee Anthony Taylor, who stopped play in the 29th minute on Friday and a 47-year-old man was ejected from Anfield.\nSemenyo was also subjected to racist abuse on Instagram on Friday night. The 25-year-old shared some of the abuse on his story, with the caption: \"When will it stop?\"\nMeta has told Sky Sports News it is investigating. It is understood the social media company are removing comments and disabling the offending accounts.\nSemenyo said the response to the incident showed football at its best \"when it mattered most\". The incident was strongly condemned by representatives of both teams, while the Premier League has said it will launch a full investigation.\nWriting on social media on Saturday, Semenyo, who scored two goals before Liverpool claimed a 4-2 win, said: \"Last night at Anfield will stay with me forever - not because of one person's words, but because of how the entire football family stood together.\n\"To my Bournemouth team-mates who supported me in that moment, to the Liverpool players and fans who showed their true character, to the Premier League officials who handled it professionally - thank you. Football showed its best side when it mattered most.\n\"Scoring those two goals felt like speaking the only language that truly matters on the pitch. This is why I play - for moments like these, for my team-mates, for everyone who believes in what this beautiful game can be.\n\"The overwhelming messages of support from across the football world remind me why I love this sport. We keep moving forward, together.\"\nIn a statement released on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"It has been a depressing start to the season as racist incidents quickly stack up. Although this might appear symptomatic of the current climate right now, clubs have shown this week there is no tolerance for this type of behaviour.\n\"But that is only made clear when authorities move swiftly and decisively to hold offenders to account. Football must remain firm in standing up to every incident of discrimination this season and be transparent about its collective actions so that everyone can see how effectively this is being tackled.\"\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola were spoken to by referee Taylor when the incident at Anfield occurred, leading to the game being paused.\n\"I am told via the Premier League Match Centre that Antoine Semenyo was the subject of a racist comment from the crowd,\" reported Sky Sports' Peter Drury at the time on commentary.\nSky Sports' Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher called the incident \"despicable,\" with Neville saying: \"It overshadows what should be an amazing night; the first day of the Premier League season, a beautiful day, and that boy has [reported being] racially abused.\n\"It's despicable. However, it has happened. It will keep on happening. It's a sorry state.\"\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes football has to continue to try to educate the next generation about racism.\n\"The only thing we can do is deal with it by dealing with him personally and try to educate the next generation,\" Van Dijk said. \"That is the only way to try and kick it out, in my opinion.\n\"I can't believe it. These things shouldn't happen but unfortunately it does and it is an absolute disgrace in my eyes.\n\"First and foremost these things should never happen in the world, not only football. But in general racism is not of this world in my opinion, but if we are to be realistic, unfortunately, it still exists and that is the painful side of it.\n\"We have to deal with it in the here and now.\"\nVan Dijk offered words of support to Semenyo, adding: \"I am here for Antoine, whenever he needs it and we are here as a club to deal with it in the best way possible because it shouldn't happen.\n\"But we stand with him completely.\"\nMerseyside Police said after the game: \"Merseyside Police will not tolerate hate crime of any form. We take incidents like this very seriously, and in cases like this we will be proactively seeking football banning orders, with the club, against those responsible.\"\nThe incident came two days after Tottenham's Mathys Tel received racist abuse online after missing a penalty in his side's Super Cup win against Paris Saint-Germain.",

        "title": "Newcastle look blunt without Alexander Isak as West Ham's Graham Potter sinks to a low - Premier League Hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nJamie Carragher hit out at Liverpool's \"unbelievable\" and \"absolutely shocking\" defending in their 4-2 win over Bournemouth - saying they will not retain their Premier League title if they continue with those standards.\nLiverpool won on an emotional night at Anfield thanks to late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah - but they were given a real scare by the Cherries as Antoine Semenyo's quickfire double cancelled out goals either side of half-time by Hugo Ekitike and Cody Gakpo.\nBoth of Semenyo's goals saw Liverpool caught out on the transition - with Bournemouth's second goal seeing the young forward run nearly the length of the pitch before finding the bottom corner.\nCarragher also hit out at Ibrahima Konate, who he felt was responsible for poor defending for both goals.\n\"It is unbelievable,\" said Carragher on Friday Night Football . \"It's fantastic from Semenyo - but Liverpool have had this problem.\n\"How many players were ahead of the ball - maybe eight players - when they were winning 2-1? That can't happen. It's absolutely shocking at this level.\n\"For Semenyo to run that far and get his shot away is incredible - but where Konate is going? He had a really poor night tonight at centre-back.\"\nArne Slot was right post-match. \"It was a great game to watch\", he declared. \"This is what fans want to see.\"\nThis was everything a Premier League opener should be about. Entertainment, high intensity, comebacks and throwbacks. Exquisite goals as well as the rough and ready kind. It had the lot.\nAnd therefore, the fact it has been tainted by one senseless act of alleged racist abuse from a so-called fan at Anfield is especially disappointing. What should be celebrated, however, is Semenyo's response to that idiocy.\nHe gave Milos Kerkez and, latterly, Andy Robertson the runaround, scoring with two of his three shots on target, from an expected goals value of just 0.89. His performance was a triumph of talent and resolve and shows exactly why he had so many clubs interested this summer.\nThe fact Bournemouth have tied him down to a new five-year deal is a massive coup and also reason for optimism moving forward. Laura Hunter\n\nNewcastle presented a united front after their goalless draw with Aston Villa. Eddie Howe described their performance as \"magnificent\". Anthony Gordon and Dan Burn talked up their togetherness and team spirit in difficult circumstances.\nA point at Villa Park represents a positive result but they would likely have been celebrating all three had Alexander Isak been available. Their star striker, training on his own as he continues to hold out for a move to Liverpool, was sorely missed.\nIsak, scorer of 23 Premier League goals last season, would doubtless have buried one of the first-half chances that fell to his team-mates. The game was a reminder of his importance. Newcastle have failed to win any of their last six Premier League games without him. They have not even scored in the last four. Their shots were worth 1.43 expected goals at Villa Park but they failed to capitalise.\nHowe improvised in Isak's absence, using Gordon centrally with Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga either side. \"I really like it,\" said Gordon of his new role afterwards. \"As my career progresses, I think I might end up more central.\"\nHe had his moments. Most notably with the run in behind to force Ezri Konsa's red card. But overall this was another reminder of the huge task Newcastle will face to replace Isak if he does go. With fans turning against him, it is a reality they may soon have to confront. Nick Wright\nLapses in concentration have now cost Aston Villa in back-to-back games.\nOld Trafford against Manchester United in the last game of the 2024/25 season and now the opener in the 2025/26 campaign. Two red cards for two key players.\nVilla had just gathered momentum in the fixture following the restart. Boubacar Kamara went close with a header and Ollie Watkins rifled his shot directly at Nick Pope.\n\"The red card changed the game,\" Emery said in his post-match press conference.\nHe was right. Anthony Gordon darted behind the defence and was racing through on goal, leaving Ezri Konsa with little choice other than to drag the makeshift forward down.\nVilla did well to gather themselves after that incident, but last season showed how costly dropping points could prove to be.\nBefore Konsa's challenge, it looked like Emery's side were gathering real momentum and could go on to win the fixture.\nIt is by no means a disastrous start to the season for Villa but securing that first win now gets harder.\nThey travel to Brentford for their next fixture and will need to call upon their only other centre-back off the bench, Pau Torres, to play alongside fellow left-footer Tyrone Mings. Patrick Rowe\n\nErling Haaland scored 22 Premier League goals last season and was deemed to have had a disappointing campaign. He scored two on the opening day at Wolves and still didn't make the headlines.\nSuch is his scoring prowess, it is taken for granted. But make no mistake: his fitness and form remains a key ingredient in Manchester City's recipe for success.\nPep Guardiola's side look like they will be in the title mix this season, reinvigorated by the class of Tijjani Reijnders and inspired by the magic of Rayan Cherki. But Haaland was perfectly placed to tuck in their opener and his firm finish for the third indicated he is sharp.\nThe striker was blunt with his assessment of City's underperformance last term but while new stars have created a buzz, Guardiola is relying on Haaland to hit the extraordinary levels we've seen from him in the past. He's off to a good start. Peter Smith\nWolves have been tipped to have a difficult season ahead and a 4-0 home defeat certainly didn't quash those predictions.\nHowever, losing to Manchester City is not a reliable barometer to how Wolves will perform against the majority of Premier League sides and boss Vitor Pereira was keen to remain positive afterwards. \"We committed a mistake, they scored,\" he said of City's finishing, while talking up his team's approach to the challenge.\nHowever, he also admitted he is hoping for three or four players 'at least' before the transfer window closes and there's no doubt a side shorn of the magic of Matheus Cunha needs a spark.\nWhether that can be found in the market remains to be seen - and could dictate the direction of Wolves' season. Peter Smith\n\nSuggestions were made about an exit plan for Richarlison this summer. The forward only managed four league starts for Tottenham last season and 500 minutes in total. His four goals were indicative of a campaign blighted by injuries, with form impossible to come by as a bit-part player under Ange Postecoglou.\nBut this version of Richarlison, fully fit and firing, is altogether different. He finally looks ready to live up to the promise of a No 9, buoyed by Thomas Frank's trust to play the starring role ahead of Dominic Solanke.\nAn impressive double in Tottenham's 3-0 win over Burnley hinted at a player rejuvenated. It's hard to imagine a more perfect start for new boss Frank, with summer addition Mohammed Kudus providing both assists for Richarlison to deliver two special goals.\nThe forward has only teased his quality since arriving in north London from Everton back in 2022. Many questioned his £60m price tag. They were right to. But if this latest performance is a sign of things to come, excitement should swiftly replace the apathy. Laura Hunter\nAfter Burnley's defeat to Spurs, Scott Parker admitted their defeat was born out of the ruthlessness of the Premier League.\n\"It's the Premier League as well and one of the biggest learnings from today, is the clinicalness you have to be at, how quick you have to get your shot off,\" Parker said.\n\"You don't have a lot of time in the Premier League, obviously, against world-class players, athletes, physically. And that's the ruthlessness of the Premier League, all concentration, keeping attention constantly, because the game at any moment can turn.\"\nBurnley, despite showing promise during phases of the game, were bettered by a clinical, savvy and physical Spurs side.\nIn the early stages of the second half as they chased an equaliser, Hannibal Mejbri's hesitance on the ball meant that chance went begging. Burnley were their architects of their own demise on the day. Maxime Esteve gave away the ball for and Tottenham opened the scoring within 10 minutes.\nA lost duel, minutes after conceding the second, led to a third as Burnley appeared to crumble. It's a lesson Parker's side will have to learn from quickly as they mount an attempt to remain in the top flight. William Bitibiri\nSunderland are the great unknows of this Premier League season.\nHow would they cope with the step up?\nHave they changed too much too soon from the Championship promotion-winning team? Would all the new signings fit in?\nEarly signs are though they could be just fine this season and it was one of the 'old guard' that impressed most.\nDan Ballard, hero of the play-off semi-final win over Coventry, rose to the occasion once again. He was a colossus. A rock. He was consistently in the right place at the right time to fend off West Ham's attacks. No player on the pitch won more duels (10) or made more clearances (8).\nHe was like Concorde - commanding the skies with his dominant aerial ability, showcased by his fantastic headed goal, one of four shots he had in the game. Big things could be on the horizon for Ballard and Sunderland this season. Lewis Jones\nWe all know what Graham Potter's teams can do in the Premier League - his Brighton team was exceptional and tactically ahead of their time. His stock was at its highest there. It's now at its lowest with questions to seriously answer about whether his football can thrive at West Ham.\nThere's a bit of identity crisis at the club.\nPotter wants to make them more possession-orientated and tactically flexible but the success West Ham under David Moyes was all about defensive organisation and creating big moments in transition. Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paqueta - West Ham's two most potent attacking players - are at their best with space to roam into. They look cramped and restricted playing in this current style. It's testament to Bowen's ability that he continues to be their star man. He didn't deserve to be on the losing side.\nPotter needs to find a solution. Lewis Jones\n\nOn the face of it, there was always going to be late drama between Brighton and Fulham. Rodrigo Muniz's late equaliser means there have been four goals scored after the 79th minute in the last three encounters.\nFor Brighton, however, there was a familiar story. Another lead dropped, another missed chance. Twenty-two points were dropped from winning positions last season. Add two more to the Fabian Hurzeler era.\nBrighton's performances under the German have been brilliant - the eighth-placed finish for the 32-year-old was under-rated in terms of Premier League achievements last season. Imagine how good they would be if they can hold on to a lead?\nBut if owner Tony Bloom wants to see his dream of being in Europe every season - then his players will need some backbone. Sam Blitz\nCarlos Baleba had been strongly linked to Manchester United this week, but he was outshone by another young gem after 25 minutes.\nIt was only Josh King's second Premier League start but the 18-year-old was doing rings around the Brighton midfielder. He was Fulham's biggest threat and the player making things happen throughout.\nThe teenager combined well with Fulham's key player from last year, Alex Iwobi, down the left, with King's directness, comfort on the ball and aggressiveness in the duels a reason why he started over the available and more experienced options of Emile Smith Rowe and Andreas Pereira.\n\"He's a top talent player and I didn't have any reservations to start with him,\" said Marco Silva. But the Fulham manager cannot rely on an 18-year-old for attacking inspiration.\nMore signings are needed - with Fulham yet to make an outfield purchase this summer. Rodrigo Muniz is wanted elsewhere and even if he stays, seven out of his last nine Premier League goals have come as a substitute. Fulham need more players like King to make the difference from the off. Sam Blitz",

        "content": "The job of a modern Premier League manager is to coach the players he has been given.\nLong gone are the days, for better or worse, when Howard Wilkinson would pick up the phone to call Alex Ferguson about signing Denis Irwin only to end up selling Eric Cantona to Manchester United.\nWith that in mind, it has been surprising to see and hear Enzo Maresca speaking publicly about why Chelsea need to sign another centre-back, while admitting they are looking for \"internal solutions\".\nThe way Maresca sees it, Chelsea have to sign someone to cover for Levi Colwill while he recovers from a serious knee injury. The only problem is that Maresca is the Chelsea head coach and he is not in charge of transfer policy.\nWhile he is a brilliant tactician with a proven track record of winning trophies and improving and developing players, he does not have the final say on who Chelsea buy and sell. The people who are in charge of that - Chelsea's football leadership team - may not necessarily share his point of view about signing another defender.\nTheir job is to build a squad of elite players which can cope with every eventuality, including a long-term injury to a key player. Judging by the fact that Chelsea won two trophies last season, including the Club World Cup, and qualified for the Champions League, they - and Maresca - seem to be doing a very good job.\nThat's a view that must be shared by Chelsea's owners, because why else would they extend the contracts of the club's sporting directors and recruitment chiefs on the eve of a new season?\nThe bottom line is that Chelsea feel they have an elite squad made up of the right blend of youth and experience. Recruitment is driven by the sporting team and they have total confidence in the squad they have assembled over a series of windows.\nThey will not sign another centre-back this summer, despite Colwill's injury, and the only way that will change is if a first-team squad central defender is sold in the next fortnight. Renato Veiga and Axel Disasi , who are not training with the first team, are already set to leave, so it would take another departure for Chelsea to consider signing a centre-back.\nChelsea have arguably one of the deepest squads in the Premier League and there are a lack of options of the required standard available in the current market. Another reason why they will not panic buy is that signing another defender just for the sake it would take away chances to play from the club's up-and-coming centre-backs.\nIn any case, Tosin Adarabioyo , Benoit Badiashile and Josh Acheampong are expected to step up to play in Colwill's role and Maresca has 10 defenders in his squad and nine who can play as centre backs, including Jorrel Hato , who moved from Ajax last month.\nTosin, who is a doubt for the Crystal Palace game, is viewed inside the club as an elite defender with great leadership qualities, while Acheampong has the potential to be one of the breakout stars of the season.\nSome seven or eight clubs have already tried to sign the 19-year-old and big things are also expected this season from Aaron Anselmino , who is only one year older. Signing another centre-back could also create problems with the balance of the squad when Colwill returns.\nMaresca must know all this, so why is he speaking in public about wanting to sign another centre-back?\nOne reason could be that he is feeling more emboldened to speak his mind now that he has won two trophies. That is unlikely to work in his favour because Chelsea's recruitment strategy is not going to be driven by what their head coach says in public, no matter how many trophies he wins.\nAnother theory is that he is doing it to lower expectations and take a little bit of pressure off himself and his players before the start of a big season. He did something similar on a few occasions last season when he denied that Chelsea were in the title race and also that he had been given the target of qualifying for the Champions League in his first season.\nPerhaps Maresca is just being honest and trying to give straight answers to straight questions. That makes good copy and is great news for journalists, but in modern football, free speech has become a privilege for employees, not a fundamental right.\nIn\nJamie Gittens - Dortmund, £51.5m\nJoao Pedro - Brighton, £60m\nLiam Delap - Ipswich, £30m\nJorrel Hato - Ajax, £38.5m\nEstevao Willian - Palmeiras, £29m\nDario Essugo - Sporting, £18.5m\nMamadou Sarr - RC Strasbourg, £12m\nKendry Paez - Independiente del Valle, £17.3m\nOut\nKendry Paez - Strasbourg, loan\nDjordje Petrovic - Bournemouth, £25m\nBashir Humphrey - Burnley, undisclosed\nMarcus Bettinelli - Man City, undisclosed\nKepa Arrizabalga - Arsenal, £5m\nMathis Amougou - Strasbourg, undisclosed\nZak Sturge - Millwall, undisclosed\nNoni Madueke - Arsenal, £52m\nCaleb Wiley - Watford, loan\nMike Penders - RC Strasbourg, loan\nJoao Felix - Al Nassr, £43.7m\nIshe Samuels-Smith - Strasbourg\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall - Everton, £29m\nLesley Ugochukwu - Burnley, undisclosed\nMarc Guiu - Sunderland, loan\nArmando Broja - Burnley, undisclosed\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Brentford have completed the signing of forward Dango Ouattara for £42m from Bournemouth in a club-record deal.\nBournemouth were reluctant to sell, but after Ouattara made it clear he wanted to leave, the Cherries had no option but to allow him to go for a price they felt was fair market value, which includes add-ons. He has signed a five-year deal.\nThe transfer surpasses Brentford's previous club-record deal of £30m when they signed striker Igor Thiago from Club Bruges last summer.\nOuattara joined Bournemouth from Lorient in January 2023 and made 88 appearances, scoring 11 goals.\nBrentford head coach Keith Andrews said: \"We're really happy to get Dango in. He's someone that we were aware and surprised could be available and, once we knew that signing him might be a possibility, we really focused on trying to get him in.\n\"We liked his Premier League experience, even at his young age, and he just hasn't found the rhythm yet because of a lack of consistent game time.\n\"He also suits the way we want to play - he has something that we were lacking in the forward line, and he will complement what we already have in the building.\n\"The fans will love him; he's the type of player that they will get off their seat for.\"\nBournemouth are looking at replacements and have Amine Adli of Bayer Leverkusen as a key target.\nSky Sports News' Richard Newman:\n\"The next two weeks are key.\n\"Iraola's Bournemouth squad is not where he hoped it would be.\n\"The defensive unit has changed dramatically - Kepa Arrizabalaga's loan from Chelsea ended without a permanent deal in place, Dean Huijsen's left for Real Madrid, Illia Zabarnyi is now at Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez lined up against his old side for Liverpool on Friday night.\n\"Some reinforcements have come in from France - Adrien Truffert and Bafode Diakite, but it's obvious there's hope there will be more.\n\"It's an unsettled period for a head coach who has Bournemouth going places, having achieved a record Premier League points tally last season when finishing ninth.\n\"But Iraola's record shows he can usually be trusted to have a plan, and the club's transfer policy is admired, so it may be that the Cherries boss will have to stay 'patient' as he put it, and all the pieces will fall into place before the window closes.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

During his two seasons at the club, the 21-year-old played 82 times and scored 14 goals.\n\"I'm really excited to be here and can't wait to get started,\" said Hutchinson. \"I've played at the City Ground a few times and it's always felt like a hostile atmosphere, so I'm looking forward to playing here with the fans behind us.\n\"I'm going to give it my all and I'm looking forward to the challenge as it's a new chapter for me, but I feel ready.\"\nMcAtee scored seven times in 34 appearances for his boyhood club Manchester City. He enjoyed two successful spells on loan at Sheffield United from 2022, playing 75 games, scoring 14 times and registering eight assists.\nMcAtee said: \"I feel ready for a new challenge and the club had a great season last year so I want to help build on that and show what I can do.\n\"I'm so happy to be here and really looking forward to getting started with my new teammates and I know the ambition of everyone associated with the club which is something I want to be a part of.\"\nMore incomings are expected at Forest with a deal worth up to £25m also close for Stade Rennais striker Arnaud Kalimuendo while the club is also pushing to sign ex-Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz from Juventus.\nCallum Hudson-Odoi has verbally agreed terms on a new and improved contract at the City Ground.\nPrior to the flurry of activity, the club had signed just three outfield players in Dan Ndoye, Igor Jesus and Jair Cunha - while the major outgoing was the £55m sale of Anthony Elanga to Newcastle.\nForest, who host Brentford on Sunday live on Sky Sports, have endured a difficult pre-season - scoring just once in seven matches.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Newcastle manager Eddie Howe says the \"door is well and truly open\" for Alexander Isak's return - despite fans directing their anger towards the wantaway striker.\nIsak was left out of the squad for Saturday's Premier League opener at Aston Villa as he seeks a move away from the club and his absence was keenly felt in a goalless draw where the visitors failed to make their attacking dominance count.\nThe Sweden international was the subject of a rejected offer of £110m plus add-ons from Liverpool earlier in the window, but continues to train away from the first team and remains determined to join the Reds.\nSupporters vented their frustration at the full-time whistle, calling the wantaway striker \"greedy\", and while Howe said the club needed \"clarity\", he insisted that route to reintegration remains open.\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" Howe said when questioned about the latest on Isak's future. \"The door is well and truly open.\n\"He has to decide what he wants to do. We would like a resolution. We need that clarity. You don't need any kind of distraction.\n\"I am not in control of that. There is one person who can control that. Let's wait and see. I have made my stance clear. I am concentrating on the team.\"\nNewcastle supporters could be heard chanting against Isak during a post-match television interview with Anthony Gordon, who played as a false nine in the striker's absence.\n\"It has been difficult because we're a tight-knit group,\" Gordon told TNT Sports. \"But you see today, we've still got that spirit and togetherness.\n\"That will never go, regardless of individuals. We're still together. Things like this can make you better in the end.\"\nAsked later about the chants, Howe added: \"The supporters acted really well today. If afterwards, they want to say something, they are free to do that.\"\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie at Villa Park:\n\"The growing sense of frustration and anger from the Newcastle fans was evident at the end of the game when they sang 'There's only one greedy *******' as the players left the field.\n\"Eddie Howe had asked the fans to back the team. They left it till the end to make their feelings clear.\n\"Howe said afterwards the door is still open for Alexander Isak, and that only one person can give a resolution to the situation, and they need one. However, the strength of feeling from the Newcastle fans would, for me, make it even more difficult for Isak to return.\n\"Could their minds be changed? Time will tell. But I felt watching that today, it was such a sad situation. Newcastle had all their players available, apart from their talisman. With Isak in the team, they would have won.\n\n\"The supporters are upset, they're angry. They don't understand why a player earning £150,000 per week can be so unhappy. They would give their right arm to be the No 9 for Newcastle, and they can't get their heads around why Isak wouldn't want to be, or why he would conduct himself the way he has.\n\"There are young kids with 'Isak 14' shirts everywhere you look in Newcastle. There's fans with Isak tattooed on their arm because he scored in the cup final.\n\"He reduced tens of thousands of them to tears with that goal against Liverpool. Who would have thought that, just a few months later, he would have angered them the way he has?\n\"Where do Newcastle go from here? It's hard to tell. I still think it's 50/50 whether he leaves or not. If he stays, it feels like this circus will carry on and that's something Howe will not want. He said today he's made it perfectly clear what his stance is - he wants Isak back. But he's going to have to do the mother of all man-management jobs on Isak to get him back firing.\n\"If I had been given a pound for every time I had been asked what's happening with Isak, I could have bought him myself.\"\n\nSky Sports' Nick Wright:\nNewcastle presented a united front after their goalless draw with Aston Villa. Eddie Howe described their performance as \"magnificent\". Anthony Gordon and Dan Burn talked up their togetherness and team spirit in difficult circumstances.\nA point at Villa Park represents a positive result but they would likely have been celebrating all three had Alexander Isak been available. Their star striker, training on his own as he continues to hold out for a move to Liverpool, was sorely missed.\nIsak, scorer of 23 Premier League goals last season, would doubtless have buried one of the first-half chances that fell to his team-mates. The game was a reminder of his importance. Newcastle have failed to win any of their last six Premier League games without him. They have not even scored in the last four.\nHowe improvised in his absence, using Gordon centrally with Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga either side. \"I really like it,\" said Gordon of his new role afterwards. \"As my career progresses, I think I might end up more central.\"\nHe had his moments. Most notably with the run in behind to force Ezri Konsa's red card. But overall this was another reminder of the huge task Newcastle will face to replace Isak if he does go. With fans turning against him, it is a reality they may soon have to confront.",

        "title": "James McAtee: Manchester City may regret letting academy product leave after Cole Palmer and Morgan Rogers mistakes",
        "content": "\"I need him. That's why I want to keep him.\"\nPep Guardiola promised a big season - and a big future - for James McAtee when he started him in Manchester City's Community Shield last August. A year later, he is no longer in the City picture.\nThe 22-year-old academy graduate has left to join Nottingham Forest in a deal worth around £30m. Big money for a big talent who just could not find a spot in the squad.\nCity have been here before, though. They had a youngster by the name of Cole Palmer - who had roughly the same number of Premier League minutes in his final City season before leaving for Chelsea. In that similar amount of time, you could even say McAtee's attacking output was better.\nLike Palmer, McAtee did well to find the net in his brief City cameos but was never backed consistently on the biggest stage. The parallels go even further - Palmer was a key player at England's U21 European Championship-winning team in his final summer as a City player. This year, McAtee was captain of Lee Carsley's champions at the same tournament - just two years later.\nGiven how Palmer rose to fame at Chelsea, winning the Premier League Young Player of the Season award in his debut campaign at Stamford Bridge, Guardiola may feel uncomfortable letting another similar type of play go - especially considering what he said about him last summer.\n\"I said to Txiki Begiristain [City's former sporting director] in the beginning of the season, I don't want to loan him or sell him,\" added Guardiola after that Community Shield start.\n\"When you find a player in small spaces that attack the final third, have a sense of goal, it's difficult to find players of this quality.\"\nThat feeling on McAtee is shared by those who developed him. \"Pep always references how good he is in pockets,\" Brian Barry-Murphy, Manchester City's former youth coach and now Cardiff City's new boss, tells Sky Sports .\n\"What's the most significant thing about James McAtee? The tighter the spaces, the more at home and comfortable he is. He's a very specific player in that role.\"\n\nAs City's Elite Development Squad head coach, Barry-Murphy grouped Palmer, McAtee and Oscar Bobb together as three players who could \"do things with the ball that I've never seen before\". Yet the three of them feel or felt like the bridesmaids of Guardiola's affections, rather than the main attraction.\nBobb was tipped for a breakout season in the one just gone before a long-term ankle injury kept him out for nearly the entire campaign. He is back in the fold now but even then, City invested in Savinho for Bobb's right-wing role, highlighting the challenge of trying to break through when the club can just sign the world’s best young players for that area.\nThat is the main issue for City's youngsters. Despite having one of the best academies in the world, they are also blessed with financially strong owners ready to flood the first team with Europe's best talent.\nMcAtee found that out before his departure. Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki were signed in the attacking midfield position this summer for a combined £80m, while even teenage midfielder Sverre Nypan has been invested in that position for a further £12.5m.\nFor City youngsters like Palmer and McAtee, it has created a sink-or-swim surroundings that very few - Phil Foden and Rico Lewis being the only academy examples - have managed to thrive in when it comes to City’s first team.\n\"Because this City team is so dominant and so good, even if it seems like a big step up, you can do well and survive there and do well for a period,\" adds Barry-Murphy.\n\"But then you either come back out or you stay in there and become established. That's the challenge of how actually good you are.\"\nBut Palmer has proved he is good enough, only elsewhere. He is not the only City academy product to do that.\nCity let Morgan Rogers depart for Middlesbrough for just £1m - then watched him move to Aston Villa, who could have taken City's Champions League spot off them. Rogers even scored the winning goal against City at Villa Park last season.\n\nCity also allowed Liam Delap to join Ipswich for £20m last summer; he is now linking up with Palmer at Chelsea. Both of them helped City beat Chelsea to the Club World Cup trophy this summer.\nThe Delap case was a more understandable one. He was never going to outmuscle Erling Haaland out of a City starting spot during his prime years.\nBut the cases of Palmer, Rogers and now McAtee require more justification - especially given how the club will likely have been planning for how to succeed Kevin de Bruyne as soon as the Belgian hit his 30s three years ago.\nSome will justifiably point out that City's academy has been a good resource for doing exactly that: buying the best players in the world.\nLast summer, academy sales hit the £500m total since Guardiola's arrival in Manchester - not just due to selling the likes of Palmer and Co, but also installing substantial sell-on clauses so City would benefit from their next move. City cannot justify signing the best without selling their best.\nBut City's boy infamously became Chelsea's man with Palmer. Delap can do the same next season, adding to what Rogers has already done.\nThere can be huge advantages to having a solid academy, but if enough of them aren't trusted, City have proved that enough of them will come back to haunt you. Time will tell if McAtee is one of those players.\nFrom next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo give Man Utd hope even in defeat to Arsenal - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nAnother Old Trafford defeat. But this wasn't same old Manchester United.\nThere were shoots of hope in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal.\nThey played with sharp bursts of electricity and actually hurt the Gunners from different angles with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo maintaining their Premier League form of last season.\nFinally Ruben Amorim has players in central areas in attack that can cause chaos with their direct running and power.\nCunha ranked top for dribbles (6) and duels (20) whilst everything Mbeumo did was very positive despite being tightly marked for most of the encounter.\nIf they play like that at Old Trafford this season consistently, it could become a tough place for away teams to play. An expected goals tally of 1.59 suggests they were good for at least a goal. No points but a promising start.\nSomething to build on. Lewis Jones\nNottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.\nNuno had referenced a 'lack of options' in his squad midweek, something he doubled down on after an emphatic 3-1 victory. \"The club knows the needs of the squad so we have to be patient and see. The faster they come, the better,\" he said.\nPerhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.\nNew signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.\nStill, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.\nNuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want? Laura Hunter\n\nWhen Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.\nCut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.\nChelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.\nMaresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.\nSome may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.\nUltimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.\nThey will need to recover and get back up to speed quickly, as they visit West Ham on Friday, live on Sky Sports , and the Hammers will be desperate to bounce back after a tough start to the season themselves. Callum Bishop\n\nA goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.\nRaya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.\nHis best moment came in the first half, when he got his fingertips to an angled effort from Matheus Cunha. Even he wasn't sure how he pulled it off. \"I don't know how I saved it to be honest, it was very close to my feet,\" he told Sky Sports afterwards.\nGary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.\nIt was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.\nThere are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation. Nick Wright\n\nIf anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.\n\"I expect him being back and playing for us against Fredrikstad,\" was Oliver Glasner's response when asked by Sky Sports about the 27-year-old's future. But if it does turn out that was the last time Eze is seen in Palace colours, it was another reminder of just how influential he is.\nSince the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.\nHowever, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward. Callum Bishop\nBased on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.\nNo team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.\nAndrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.\nIf the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast. Laura Hunter\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Arsenal's set-piece threat and defensive resilience sees off Man Utd but Mikel Arteta knows they need more",
        "content": "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.\nMikel Arteta called it a \"massive\" result afterwards. \"To go in the first fixture at Old Trafford with that atmosphere, the way they are building momentum, with new signings and excitement around them, it's a great feeling,\" he added to Sky Sports .\nThey did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.\nNo other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.\n\nThey are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.\nEven finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.\nThey were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.\n\"Arsenal are one of the best teams at managing games and knowing how to run the clock down,\" said Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville on co-commentary. \"They are an experienced unit.\"\nTheir experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.\n\n\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.\n\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"\nThe Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.\nThe main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.\n\nThe club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.\nArteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.\nGyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.\nGyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.\nTheir passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.\nArteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.\n\"The sign of a really good team is when you're not at your best and you win football matches,\" said Sky Sports ' Roy Keane. \"The worry for me in the second half is there were opportunities to really go at Manchester United, but they seemed off it from that point of view.\n\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.\n\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"\nWhat matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Newcastle have completed the signing of midfielder Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa in a deal worth up to £43m.\nThe Magpies will pay an initial £39m plus £4m in add-ons for the 24-year-old, who has signed a five-year deal at Newcastle.\nRamsey will wear the No 41 shirt at St James' Park, as he did at Villa.\nThe sale of academy graduate Ramsey represents pure profit for Aston Villa, who have been looking to sell a player to help with their Financial Fair Play (FFP) situation.\nRamsey, who had been a long-term target for Newcastle, had two years left on his Villa contract and departs having scored 17 goals in 167 appearances across all competitions for his boyhood club.\nThe England U21 international is the fourth first-team addition to Newcastle's squad this summer and takes their overall spend above £130m, following the arrivals of Anthony Elanga, Malick Thiaw and Aaron Ramsdale.\nSpeaking as a Newcastle player for the first time, Ramsey said: \"I'm delighted to be here. It's been a mad two or three days, but I'm really happy to be here and I can't wait to get started.\n\"This is a big move for me, but as soon as I knew the gaffer was interested and really Iiked me, it didn't take much time to decide.\n\"His track record of developing players, especially those who have gone on to become internationals here, speaks for itself.\n\"It was always a tough game playing for Villa against Newcastle - the team is full of energy, so athletic and the fans are so passionate.\n\"I feel my game will suit that and I'm excited to be on the other end of it now.\"\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said Ramsey fits the profile of the \"young and hungry\" player he wants to recruit, while also bringing a wealth of Premier League experience to the club after featuring 136 times in the top flight.\n\"Jacob is another fantastic addition to our squad,\" said Howe.\n\n\"His qualities will bring us something different on the pitch and he fits the profile of being young and hungry to develop, but also with a wealth of Premier League football under his belt.\n\"Jacob offers versatility and his directness in attack has proven to be a real threat at this level in recent seasons. He performed very well in the Champions League last season, too, and we believe he'll be a major asset for us.\"\nNewcastle manager Eddie Howe says the \"door is well and truly open\" for Alexander Isak's return - despite fans directing their anger towards the wantaway striker.\n\nIsak was left out of the squad for Saturday's Premier League opener at Aston Villa as he seeks a move away from the club and his absence was keenly felt in a goalless draw where the visitors failed to make their attacking dominance count.\nThe Sweden international was the subject of a rejected offer of £110m plus add-ons from Liverpool earlier in the window, but continues to train away from the first team and remains determined to join the Reds.\nSupporters vented their frustration at the full-time whistle, calling the wantaway striker \"greedy\", and while Howe said the club needed \"clarity\", he insisted that route to reintegration remains open.\n\"Nothing has changed,\" Howe said when questioned about the latest on Isak's future. \"The door is well and truly open.\n\"He has to decide what he wants to do. We would like a resolution. We need that clarity. You don't need any kind of distraction.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Eberechi Eze thought he had fired Crystal Palace into the lead at Chelsea on Sunday with a stunning free-kick, but an unusual law was applied to disallow the goal.\nThe goal would have given the visitors a priceless victory on the opening weekend at Stamford Bridge.\nSky Sports explains why it was ruled out...\n\nChelsea defender Marc Cucurella committed a foul on Will Hughes just outside of the area and Eze blasted the free-kick past goalkeeper Robert Sanchez to put Crystal Palace ahead in the 13th minute.\nHowever, the VAR James Bell spotted that Palace captain Marc Guehi had pushed Moises Caicedo to create a gap for the ball to fly through and, in doing so, had moved too close to the Chelsea wall when the ball was struck.\nReferee Darren England ruled out the goal after consulting the pitchside monitor and announced the decision to Stamford Bridge. He said: \"After review, the Crystal Palace No 6 [Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free-kick and a disallowed goal.\"\nSky Sports' Chris Sutton said on co-commentary that the decision was \"scandalous\" and \"extremely harsh\".\n\nThe IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play. \"If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.\"\nOne similar incident occurred last season, although it went unpunished, which coincidentally was also in Chelsea's favour.\nReece James scored a free-kick to equalise in the 95th minute against Bournemouth in January.\nHowever, two Chelsea players, Marc Cucurella and Tosin, were stood within a metre of the Bournemouth wall. The goal should have been ruled out.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner says the Premier League has to be careful with the law.\n\"I know we have to be one yard away from the wall,\" he said. \"I think maybe we have a situation where we sometimes try to block like everybody's doing. And, obviously, the block started too early.\n\"But the Premier League has to be careful when they disallow these kind of goals. Because I think in every direct free-kick, there are blocks somewhere around the wall. But, of course, we have to accept it because that's the rule.\n\"I was a little bit surprised, because VAR is treated or handled very, very cautiously here in England, which I really appreciate. It's always about supporting the referee's own field decision.\n\"My great team, who is always watching all the set-plays, will watch it again and find a solution so that in the next case it won't happen again that the goal is disallowed, and then we can celebrate and hopefully win.\"\nMicah Richards said: \"There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.\"\nRoy Keane added: \"Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.\n\"Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

Who knows that this is the truth, what is written? There are rumours and so many rumours, and everybody tells somebody something for their own advantage, maybe.\n\"I watch the players every single day in the training sessions. If most of the things that are written about them is true, they couldn't perform like this, the team couldn't be together like this, the team couldn't be committed to each other like they are. It's just not possible.\n\"He was picked because he's a Crystal Palace player and he's a very good Crystal Palace player. He trained the whole week, so there was no reason not to pick him.\"\nGlasner then revealed Eze's £68m release clause has now expired. He said: \"I'm quite calm, but I also know, we have two weeks to go, and I know Ebs' clause is gone, so it's the club's decision, and we will see what happens.\"\nEze has been one of Spurs' top targets this summer. A bid has not yet been made and Palace value him at £70m, with two years left on his contract.\nPalace host Fredrikstad on Thursday in the first leg of their UEFA Conference League qualifying play-off and Glasner expects Eze to be involved again.\nHe said: \"He will come in tomorrow [Monday] to Crystal Palace's training ground, and have recovery. We will ensure a Tuesday off and we will meet Wednesday, and I expect him being back and playing for us against Fredrikstad.\"\n\nSky Sports' Chris Sutton, speaking at Stamford Bridge, contrasted Eze's situation with that of Alexander Isak at Newcastle - where he has not featured for the club, or trained alongside his team-mates, since he announced his desire to leave earlier this summer.\n\"He seems like a good type,\" he said. \"If the situation with Tottenham happens, it'll happen. We've seen the situation at Newcastle with how Alexander Isak has downed tools and isn't the most popular person among the Newcastle faithful.\n\"If you're Oliver Glasner, you want your best players starting.

I'm really proud of the guys. They were really brave in everything they did during the game,\" he told Sky Sports .\n\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home.\n\"We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.\n\"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.\n\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.\n\"We need to win games but that was a completely different game to last season.\"\n\nUnited will look to convert another positive performance into points in their next fixture when they face Fulham, live on Super Sunday , on August 24.\nSky Sports' Roy Keane took an opposing view to Amorim's assessment of the performance, after arguing there is still cause for concern at the club despite the encouraging showing from the new recruits.\n\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is OK with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better,\" Keane said on Super Sunday .\n\n\"It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.\n\"Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Man Utd.\"\nFellow United legend and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville was more upbeat after the defeat, as he focused on the positive performances from Cunha and Mbeumo, as well as other positives that emerged from the loss.\nSpeaking after the game, he said: \"I thought they [United] played well, they were the better team in terms of performance.\n\"We know that performance isn't enough sometimes. Arsenal have got real resilience and can grind out 1-0 victories.\n\"There were some positives. Mbeumo in the first half and Cunha in the second half. They showed they can handle a big game at Old Trafford, they showed they have got the quality and ability. We obviously know that from Wolves.\n\"This is a tough start. Arsenal are a tough team to break down. I'm not too downhearted. I thought the system worked better and the back three did better.\n\"Casemiro and Fernandes did well in midfield; they held their own.

        "title": "Gary Neville says Man Utd need a goalkeeper, but would Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma fit?",
        "content": "Sky Sports' Gary Neville says Manchester United 'unequivocally' need a new goalkeeper despite Ruben Amorim's defence of No 2 Altay Bayindir after his error led to Arsenal's 1-0 win on Super Sunday.\nThe stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.\nDespite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.\nThe game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.\nOn the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.\n\n\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.\n\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.\n\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.\n\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.\n\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.\n\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.\n\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.\n\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.\n\n\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.\n\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.\n\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nMan Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.\nHe told Sky Sports : \"We have players to win any Premier League game.\n\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"\nReflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.\n\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.\n\n\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.\n\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"\nAmorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.\n\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.\n\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…\n\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"\nMeanwhile, Sky Sports pundits Roy Keane and Micah Richards rowed over Bayindir's culpability for Arsenal's winner.\nFormer United midfielder Keane had no sympathy for the Turk, who appealed for a foul, with the Sky Sports pundit saying: \"He has to come with violence, he's got to be aggressive, he's got to be almost saying to players, 'Come in here, I'm happy to deal with it'.\n\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"\nFellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.\n\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"\nThat prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.\n\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.\n\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"\nKeane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

        "title": "Arsenal's slender victory at Man Utd analysed by for Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher in Ref Watch",
        "content": "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher is back for a new season of Ref Watch on Sky Sports News and starts by taking a look at the key incidents from Arsenal's 1-0 win at Man Utd.\nShould Riccardo Calafiori's winning goal for Arsenal have been disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper Altay Bayindir? Should Matheus Cunha have won a penalty after a foul by William Saliba?\nAlso, Dermot discusses all the other major refereeing talking points from the opening weekend.\n\nINCIDENT: Matheus Cunha went to ground in the penalty area after a challenge from William Saliba. Did Saliba get the ball? Referee said no penalty.\nDERMOT SAYS: I wasn't convinced it was a penalty. What I would say is if it is going to be a penalty it's one the referee is going to give. VAR will not get involved in this.\nJay Bothroyd on Sky Sports News:\n\"How is that not a penalty? It's a guaranteed penalty.\n\"If it happens on the halfway line it is a free kick.\n\"Saliba has hit his foot and the ball has gone nowhere. If Saliba isn't there Cunha doesn't go down. It's a penalty.\"\n\nINCIDENT: William Saliba stood in close contact with Altay Bayındır as Arsenal score at Old Trafford - was it a foul?\nDERMOT SAYS: Not a foul. Not a foul at all. If anything the goalkeeper puts his hand on the player.\nJay Bothroyd on Sky Sports News:\n\"He hasn't been strong enough, he's caught out of position and that mistake has cost Man United the game. If he thinks it's a foul, go down, at least you've got a chance of winning a free kick. It's just poor, you need to be stronger.\"\n\n\nINCIDENT: Eberechi Eze free kick disallowed by VAR after Marc Guehi interfered with the wall.\nDERMOT SAYS: This is the law. If a wall is set up with three or more players, opposition players have to be a metre from it. Often you see forwards standing in front of the wall. In this case, Guehi is stood between two players.\nWhere they set up, Guehi initially is not deemed to be in the wall, he's between two players to the right of the wall, but as the ball is kicked, Guehi's movement is towards Caicedo and without doubt, he's not a metre from it.\nYou don't see it often. Most free kicks don't result in a goal, and because this one does, VAR has to check it.\nIt was all about Caicedo moving into the wall and Guehi being in contact with him.\nThe genie is out the bottle now.\n\nMicah Richards said: \"There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.\"\nRoy Keane added: \"Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.\n\"Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.\"\n\nINCIDENT: Senesi avoids punishment after appearing to handle the ball as the last defender.\nDERMOT SAYS: I think this is a really interesting situation. The VAR, for me, has looked at it too quickly and cleared it.\nI think he's seen the ball fly up off Senesi and has not watched the second part.\nHe's seen the ball hit the elbow off the knee and stopped looking, he hasn't looked for the second swipe. If he sends the referee to the screen, the referee has all options. He probably sends Senesi off because Huge Ekitike is going to be away. The only doubt is, is it too far from goal? But this is a class forward.\nIf it goes to the screen he would have been sent off. It was a mistake and fortunately it didn't affect the outcome of the game.\nINCIDENT: Burnley goalkeeper Dubravka gets penalised for holding the ball for more than eight seconds, resulting in an opposition corner.\n\nDERMOT SAYS: If you watch, he does take too long. I get a bit concerned with the eight seconds, because we don't want to have to get the stop watch out. But he's making no attempt to release the ball.\nIt's a deterrent. That's why the rule is there. No referee wants to have to apply that rule, they want goalkeepers to get rid of the ball and keep the game moving faster.\nJay Bothroyd on Sky Sports News:\n\"I don't know why he's holding onto the ball for so long, it's about 12 seconds.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Championship talking points: Wrexham still winless, Lampard's Coventry soar & Sheff Utd slump again",
        "content": "\n\nResult: Wrexham 2-3 West Brom\nWrexham have not been used to losing matches in recent years - but they are certainly not used to losing at the Racecourse.\nIn the three seasons prior to their return to the second tier for the first time since 1982/83, they either won or drew 64 games, losing just five.\nBut it became six in 70 when West Brom turned the game on Saturday lunchtime. Following the opening day loss at Southampton, it was also the first time they had lost back-to-back league games since February 2024.\nThis was the first of four home games in six and Sky Sports Football 's Don Goodman said: \"Home is where the heart has to be for Wrexham. This is where they want to be strong.\n\"They are going to have to find a way to maybe just be a little bit more creative in open play.\"\nKevin Phillips added: \"Is there a mini-crisis starting to happen? They've not had back-to-back losses for two years, so they've got a bit of a battle in front of them now.\"\nWrexham will need the experience of older heads like Kieffer Moore and Conor Coady but boss Phil Parkinson is still hoping for more activity, saying: \"We're looking across the board. We probably do need a couple more players.\" Dan Long\n\nResult: Derby 3-5 Coventry\nIt was, undoubtedly, the game of the weekend in the Championship. Coventry City led early, trailed early in the second half and then bounced back to flummox Derby County with a flurry of late goals.\nIt proved quite the difference for Frank Lampard's side from their opening-day goalless draw at home to Hull City, and hopefully for him proved a sign of what is to come from his side and the impressive attacking options he has at his disposal.\nIt would have also provided him with some minor satisfaction, no doubt, as he claimed a first win in his second attempt on his return to Pride Park.\n\"I thought we were fantastic,\" said Lampard. \"It was a really tough match for us because of the style of Derby which makes it really difficult and I thought we dealt with it brilliantly.\n\"One of the biggest things is that we showed belief at 3-2 down, there was a feeling for me that we could still do something and the players did it so it's one of my favourite games that I've had since I've been here.\"\nFor Derby, meanwhile, it is now two defeats from two and eight goals shipped in that time. No other side in the league has conceded more than five. There is work to do. Simeon Gholam\n\nResult: Sheff Wed 0-3 Stoke\nThe spirit both on and off the field is evident at Sheffield Wednesday, but this was a stark reminder that pluck alone won't be enough for Championship survival.\nThe Wednesday fans marched through Hillsborough Park before kick-off, and their whistle protest had barely begun when Million Manhoef fired Stoke into an early lead.\nThe supporters though stayed right behind the players, directing their anger towards owner Dejphon Chansiri .\nWednesday started the first half slowly, and did so again in the second when Divin Mubama doubled the lead, before Manhoef's second completed the job for Stoke.\nMuch of the focus will be on Wednesday's plight, and Mark Robins won't mind that too much. Stoke were impressive and have won their first two league games of the season for the first time since winning promotion in 2007/08.\nIs Robins the manager to finally break Stoke's curse? Rob Jones\n\nResult: Swansea 1-0 Sheff Utd\nMind the gap? Sheffield United are propping up the Championship with their troubled rivals right now.\nToo early to look at the table? With ominous clouds lingering and questions unanswered after a summer of upheaval, not necessarily.\nUnited look anything but right now after three defeats from three under Ruben Selles, the latest a confused and disconnected display at Swansea that ended with an exchange between star player Gus Hamer and a frustrated away end. The mood is already volatile, with Middlesbrough, Ipswich and Southampton to come before September is out.\nSky Sports wrote ahead of an opening 4-1 thumping by Bristol City that the high-stakes call to replace Chris Wilder was likely to undermine United's promotion prospects.\nThe spine of a team that accrued 92 points last season has been swapped for unproven replacements and while quality remains in attacking areas, the squad is short on depth, physicality and experience. Selles, the lone voice so far amid a sea change that requires structural support, has already called out the recruitment process as \"not good enough\".\nThe new boss needs tangible backing in the transfer market before the deadline.\nSigns of buy-in for his ideas on the pitch must also come soon. Kate Burlaga\n\nResult: Millwall 0-3 Middlesbrough\nIt's been 31 years since Middlesbrough started a league campaign with back-to-back wins, but that changed emphatically on Saturday.\nA 4-0 demolition by Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup midweek meant Rob Edwards' side had a fire in their belly to prove the doubters wrong, and they did just that.\nAfter a first half where there was little to separate the two sides, Middlesbrough came out fighting in the second to take all three points with three goals.\nHayden Hackney opened the scoring with a calm and collected first-time finish following a Morgan Whittaker cross, before Alfie Jones added another in the 87th minute following a corner.\nThings got worse for Millwall in injury time, as Delano Burgzorg sealed the deal with a third. Both sides have their sights set on the play-off spots this season, but Boro fans will be hoping that Edwards can repeat his Luton trick. Harriet Prior\n\nResult: Ipswich 1-1 Southampton\nFor a side that struck 92 goals during their promotion-winning Championship campaign two seasons ago, Ipswich have looked lightweight and lacking in confidence in front of goal as they start their pursuit of a quick return to the Premier League.\nMissing the muscle and ferocity of Liam Delap, who departed for Chelsea this summer, and the creative flair of Omar Hutchinson, who completed his £37.5m switch to Nottingham Forest earlier this week, George Hirst is tasked with leading the line.\nHirst grabbed a last-gasp equaliser from the spot at Birmingham on the opening day of the season, but has been isolated in attack so far this term, especially in the 1-1 draw at home to Southampton on Sunday - a draw that did, however, stop a nine-match league losing streak for Kieran McKenna's men at Portman Road.\nSam Szmodics was the pick of Ipswich's attack against Saints, his waspish style causing problems and, barring the foot of the post, he would have opened his own campaign for the season.\nIt is early days of course and the arrival of forward Chuka Akpom, who was watching from the stands on Sunday after joining on a season-long loan, will give the Ipswich fans hope that the good times - and goals - are just around the corner again.

        "title": "Premier League season predictions: Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville pick the teams and players to watch in 2025/26",
        "content": "Speaking on Monday Night Football , Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville made their 2025/26 Premier League season predictions.\nGary Neville - Arsenal (but it's too close to call)\nI couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool. I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it.\nArsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.\n\nLiverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.\nCity have an unbelievable spine.\nI went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.\nJamie Carragher - Liverpool, ahead of Man City\nWhat I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.\nA few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.\nI was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.\nNeville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd\nI've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!\nIt was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.\nAnd I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.\n\nCarragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea\nI think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.\nNeville - Nottingham Forest\nFor Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.\n\nNeville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves\nBrentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…\n\nCarragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley\nIt's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.\nNeville - Brentford\nIt will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.\nCarragher - West Ham\nIt wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.\n\nCarragher - Erling Haaland\nMohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.\nNeville - Viktor Gyokeres\nI thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.\nHe's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.\nCarragher - Florian Wirtz\nIt's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.\n\nCarragher - Estevao\nHe's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.\nNeville - Adrien Truffert\nI was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.\nNeville - Ruben Amorim\nThere's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.\nCarragher - Oliver Glasner\nI think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been released on bail following his arrest after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused during the first game of the Premier League season, Merseyside Police said.\nThe man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence and was taken into custody to be interviewed.\nHe has since been released on conditional bail, with enquiries ongoing, Merseyside Police told Sky Sports News.\nAs part of his bail conditions, the man cannot attend any regulated football match in the UK and not go within one mile of a designated football stadium.\nSemenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator to referee Anthony Taylor, who stopped play in the 29th minute on Friday and a 47-year-old man was ejected from Anfield.\nSemenyo was also subjected to racist abuse on Instagram on Friday night. The 25-year-old shared some of the abuse on his story, with the caption: \"When will it stop?\"\nMeta told Sky Sports News it was investigating. It is understood the social media company are removing comments and disabling the offending accounts.\nSemenyo said the response to the incident showed football at its best \"when it mattered most\". The incident was strongly condemned by representatives of both teams, while the Premier League has said it will launch a full investigation.\nWriting on social media on Saturday, Semenyo, who scored two goals before Liverpool claimed a 4-2 win, said: \"Last night at Anfield will stay with me forever - not because of one person's words, but because of how the entire football family stood together.\n\"To my Bournemouth team-mates who supported me in that moment, to the Liverpool players and fans who showed their true character, to the Premier League officials who handled it professionally - thank you. Football showed its best side when it mattered most.\n\"Scoring those two goals felt like speaking the only language that truly matters on the pitch. This is why I play - for moments like these, for my team-mates, for everyone who believes in what this beautiful game can be.\n\"The overwhelming messages of support from across the football world remind me why I love this sport. We keep moving forward, together.\"\nIn a statement released on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"It has been a depressing start to the season as racist incidents quickly stack up. Although this might appear symptomatic of the current climate right now, clubs have shown this week there is no tolerance for this type of behaviour.\n\"But that is only made clear when authorities move swiftly and decisively to hold offenders to account. Football must remain firm in standing up to every incident of discrimination this season and be transparent about its collective actions so that everyone can see how effectively this is being tackled.\"\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola were spoken to by referee Taylor when the incident at Anfield occurred, leading to the game being paused.\n\"I am told via the Premier League Match Centre that Antoine Semenyo was the subject of a racist comment from the crowd,\" reported Sky Sports' Peter Drury at the time on commentary.\nSky Sports' Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher called the incident \"despicable,\" with Neville saying: \"It overshadows what should be an amazing night; the first day of the Premier League season, a beautiful day, and that boy has [reported being] racially abused.\n\"It's despicable. However, it has happened. It will keep on happening. It's a sorry state.\"\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes football has to continue to try to educate the next generation about racism.\n\"The only thing we can do is deal with it by dealing with him personally and try to educate the next generation,\" Van Dijk said. \"That is the only way to try and kick it out, in my opinion.\n\"I can't believe it. These things shouldn't happen but unfortunately it does and it is an absolute disgrace in my eyes.\n\"First and foremost these things should never happen in the world, not only football. But in general racism is not of this world in my opinion, but if we are to be realistic, unfortunately, it still exists and that is the painful side of it.\n\"We have to deal with it in the here and now.\"\nVan Dijk offered words of support to Semenyo, adding: \"I am here for Antoine, whenever he needs it and we are here as a club to deal with it in the best way possible because it shouldn't happen.\n\"But we stand with him completely.\"\nMerseyside Police said after the game: \"Merseyside Police will not tolerate hate crime of any form. We take incidents like this very seriously, and in cases like this we will be proactively seeking football banning orders, with the club, against those responsible.\"\nThe incident came two days after Tottenham's Mathys Tel received racist abuse online after missing a penalty in his side's Super Cup defeat against Paris Saint-Germain.\nKick It Out CEO Hollie Varney has praised Semenyo for his reaction to the situation and the way it was dealt with by the Bournemouth forward during the game at Anfield.\n\"The way Semenyo reacted was fantastic,\" Varney told Sky Sports News . \"It was incredibly inspiring. The action has to be led by football authorities and those in charge; it shouldn't be on players to address the issues.\n\"He shouldn't expect the abuse to happen simply for going to work. What we would like to see is a consistent framework in how we deal with abuse and the consequences that are carried out.",

        "title": "Thomas Frank's Tottenham are flexible, Nottingham Forest change it up and Man Utd's possession in The Debrief",
        "content": "Welcome to The Debrief , a Sky Sports column in which Adam Bate uses a blend of data and opinion to reflect on some of the key stories from the latest Premier League matches. This week:\n\nHaving been in Udine to see Tottenham come close to doing a number on Paris Saint-Germain, the question was whether or not they would be able to adjust their style of play three days later against Burnley. Thomas Frank answered that emphatically.\nThe passing of Guglielmo Vicario illustrated that most clearly in their 3-0 win on Saturday. Having directed the ball long against PSG, the Spurs goalkeeper switched the focus to ball retention against Burnley, attempting only two kicks over the halfway line.\nIn fact, Spurs as a side attempted the most passes inside their own half of any team on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. Frank pointed out afterwards that the move for Richarlison's second goal featured 17 passes - and included Vicario.\nRicharlison impressed again and with 13 goals in his last 16 starts, is emerging once more as a robust alternative to Dominic Solanke. The Brazilian registered three shots on target inside the penalty box - equalling his record for any game in his Premier League career.\nIn midfield, Frank trusted two teenagers, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall, with Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha dropping to the bench. At the back, Kevin Danso, the new long-throw specialist, made way to accommodate Brennan Johnson - who duly scored.\nIt has been a promising start for Frank, particularly given that he had to manage those midweek exertions in Italy. His flexibility was a factor in his appointment, having been a persistent source of criticism for his predecessor and he got the balance right against Burnley.\n\nSpurs not only created, scoring three against a side that did not even concede two in a single league game last season, but did so while keeping a clean sheet - their first in this competition since February and as many as in their previous 18 home games.\nIt is Manchester City away next, which will be as difficult as it gets. But Frank has already shown supporters that he is capable of setting this team up in whatever way that the match situation demands. Keep a close eye on Vicario's pass choices in that one.\n\nA build-up attack is defined as a sequence in open play that contains 10 or more passes and ends either in a shot on goal or at least a touch inside the box. The team that did that the most times on the opening Premier League weekend was Nottingham Forest.\nNuno Espirito Santo's team did it seven times in their 3-1 win over Brentford, which is unusual because the most they managed in any game last season was just five. They ranked bottom but one in the Premier League for build-up attacks during that campaign.\nOf course, it was a hugely successful season for Forest in which they came so close to securing Champions League football. But their style was built on containment without the ball and counter-attacking with it - they ranked top for the direct speed of their attacks.\nThere was still evidence of that in beating Brentford. Chris Wood's second goal came from a transition and it is clear that Forest will keep setting the traps that did for so many last year. But against Brentford there were also examples of clever pressing, of a possession game.\nForest completed 126 passes in the final third - the most of any Premier League team. After a pre-season in which Nuno complained about the lack of additions and one that featured no fewer than five goalless draws, maybe they have added some new aspects, after all.\nThat could prove important. Had Forest beaten Leicester at home - or indeed Brentford at the City Ground - towards the back end of last season, it could have been enough for a top-five finish. The manner of this performance suggests Nuno is out to address that.\n\nRoy Keane may have bemoaned the erosion of standards that have led to Manchester United's home defeat to Arsenal being viewed as a positive step but the reality is that Ruben Amorim's side exceeded most expectations with their performance on Sunday.\nIt was not just that they caused one of the title favourites such problems but it was the way that they dominated the ball that surprised. Regardless of the game state, United have not done that against one of the top teams for a long time - and the stats back that up.\nIn Premier League matches against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City - last season's top four and the favourites to contend this time around - you have to go back almost a decade to find an example of United having 60 per cent of the possession.\nAll three examples since Sir Alex Ferguson left came under Louis van Gaal in 2015. If Amorim can begin to fuse the possession game of the Dutchman with the potent running power of new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha then there is hope.\nBoth Mbeumo and Cunha had chances to mark their Premier League debuts for the club with a goal. That they did not owes something to David Raya in the Arsenal goal and that dreaded phrase 'regression to the mean' that has been muttered about both men.\nMbeumo scored 20 goals for Brentford last season from an expected-goals tally of just 12.26. In every single game in which he had better chances than this last season, he scored. Remarkably, the same statistic was also true of Cunha. Rotten luck for United.\nAnd yet, despite that disappointment, the overriding feeling is that if Amorim can keep getting the ball to his talented ball carriers in good areas then, whether it is Benjamin Sesko or Mason Mount up front with them, United will be a very different proposition this season.",

        "title": "Cristian Romero: Tottenham captain signs new long-term contract with club after summer of uncertainty over future",
        "content": "Tottenham captain Cristian Romero has signed a new long-term contract with the club to end the uncertainty over his future.\nSky Sports News understands the 27-year-old has penned a four-year deal to keep him at the club until the summer of 2029.\nThe Argentina international's fresh terms are a huge boost to Spurs, with Romero having just two years left on his previous deal, and he was of interest to Atletico Madrid this summer.\nThe defender's deal comes just five days after he was named as the club's new captain by boss Thomas Frank following the departure of Heung-Min Son to LAFC.\nUpon signing his new deal, Romero said: \"I'm very happy here in the club. For me, this club is the best in the world.\n\"The last two weeks, first becoming captain and now signing the contract with the club. For me, it's a fantastic decision\n\"My message to the fans is thank you for your amazing support every day and every match. For me, and it's important also for the team.\"\n\n\nHe added: \"Going on to the pitch with my son [on Saturday before the win over Burnley], it's special for me. First time as captain and it is incredible for me.\n\"I love football, I love this club. It's special for me going to the pitch with him.\n\"After winning the Europa League, it's like a special season now. In football, sometimes there are good moments, bad moments. The most important thing for me is to stay all together.\n\"We want to win. Maybe, why not again this season? Another trophy with the club is important for everyone.\"\n\nSky Sports News understands Romero's new contract was drawn up once he was made captain.\nSpurs acted quickly to tie Romero down to an extension, as he was into the final two years of his previous deal, while the new contract ensures the north London club protect his value.\nIt is also understood Spurs never considered Atletico's interest in Romero, and keeping the centre-back was a priority this summer.\n\nThe future of Romero is understood to have been key to discussions with Frank when he was appointed Spurs boss in June.\nFrank chose to make Romero captain when it was decided that Son was leaving, and Romero is believed to be extremely happy with the way things have gone in the first few months under the Dane.\nRomero scored in his first game as Tottenham skipper last week in the UEFA Super Cup defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, before helping Spurs to victory in their Premier League season opener on Saturday in a 3-0 home win over Burnley.\n\nThe World Cup winner has been a key player since arriving from Atalanta in the summer of 2021, having initially joined on a season-long loan before making the move permanent the following year for a fee in the region of £42m.\nRomero was a crucial part of last season's Europa League glory, which ended the Spurs' 17-year trophy drought, as he was named player of the tournament.\nHe was also given the player of the match in the 1-0 final win over Manchester United in Bilbao.\nBut there were doubts around Romero's future despite the Europa League success as he sent out a cryptic message on social media in the wake of Ange Postecoglou's dismissal in June. In the message, he praised his achievements with the line, \"despite the many obstacles that always existed and always will exist.\"\nHowever, Romero has now begun life under Frank strongly and is targeting more silverware under the ex-Brentford boss.\nSpeaking last Friday, Frank praised Romero and explained why he had chosen him as his skipper.\n\"I see a very big and very good player. What I like about him and why I have chosen him as captain is his leadership qualities on the pitch,\" the 51-year-old said.\n\"There is a big respect for him from the players. Off the pitch as well he also sets the standards.\n\"The staff have said to me they've never seen him train that well. He's in a very good place. I see a player that will want to lead the team and push the team.\"\n\n\nFull-back Djed Spence has also signed a new deal at Spurs.\nVersatile full-back Spence only signed fresh terms last October until 2028, but has been rewarded for a fine breakthrough campaign at Tottenham.\nSpence made 35 appearances in the 2024-25 campaign, after eventually being handed his full debut in December – two-and-a-half years after he first joined the club.\nAfter Spence was deemed a “club signing” by former Tottenham boss Antonio Conte in 2022, he had mixed loans at Rennes, Leeds and Genoa, but forced his way into Postecoglou’s plans and has quickly gained the trust of Frank.",

        "title": "Luis Diaz decisive for Bayern Munich in Supercup win: Harry Kane tipping new team-mate to score 15 to 20 goals",
        "content": "Luis Diaz called it “a spectacular night” as he scored what proved to be an important second goal as Bayern Munich held on to beat VfB Stuttgart 2-1 in the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup. It was the perfect illustration of why Bayern wanted him.\nThe fee that was paid to Liverpool this summer could rise to £64.7m and that might look a little chunky for a winger who will turn 29 years old in January. But when Diaz ghosted in to head home, it was a little glimpse of what the Colombian adds to this Bayern side.\nOn the face of it, Bayern had a plethora of fine options that they were able to rotate in the wide areas last season. Given that the supporters are used to seeing such quality in those positions, the bar is set high for Diaz to impress at the Bundesliga champions.\n\nBut dig a little deeper and there is hope that he can make the difference when it matters most. For example, while Kingsley Coman, now of Al Nassr, did find the net nine times last season, each of those goals came in wins that did not actually require him to score.\nThe aggregate in those matches was 36-2.\nLeroy Sane, who has left for Galatasaray, did score two goals against St Pauli in a 3-2 win but that was the only game Bayern won directly because of his goals. Diaz has already proven decisive and, as Harry Kane explains, that is what he is capable of bringing to this team.\nAsking Kane about that after the game, he said: \"I think you can see what he brings one-v-one on the wing. Really sharp, really agile. I think his biggest asset, and probably what is going to be great for us this year, is the fact he scores goals like he did today.\"\nKane added: \"He gets into that six-yard box, he makes those runs and he has got a great finish. I think it is important, especially in this modern football, for the wingers to be scoring hopefully 15 to 20 goals a season. The goal was a great run, a great finish.\"\nThe England captain continued: \"He had a couple of others that he was unlucky with in the game. For him, it will be great confidence. Scoring in your first competitive game for a new club is great and for it to be the winning goal is a perfect start for him.\"\nKane, of course, was denied that perfect start on his own Bayern debut two summers ago when he was thrust into a Supercup on home soil that ended in a shock 3-0 defeat to RB Leipzig. His transfer had only been completed in the early hours of that morning.\nReflecting on that at the end of the night in Stuttgart, Kane now describes it all as \"a bit of a whirlwind\" and \"a crazy 24 hours\" - but the fall-out lasted longer. It robbed Bayern of momentum and they ended up relinquishing the title for the first time in 11 years.\n\"It is important to have that momentum to start the year,\" he says now. It feels particularly key after a disappointing Club World Cup, during which Jamal Musiala was seriously injured and key dressing-room figure Thomas Muller said his emotional goodbyes.\nKane admits that the players are still getting used to life without the latter. \"He only really left last week. We have to look forward, we have to move on. He was a big character but that gives other people opportunities to step up and be that leader, be that person.\"\nThere is no choice. The demands at Bayern are relentless. \"We celebrate every trophy like it is the first and we move on to the next one.\" That means looking to retain the Bundesliga title before achieving their ultimate ambition of winning the Champions League.\n\"We will be one of the favourites. PSG, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Man City, Liverpool, all the big teams are going to have their eye on that trophy. But as we know, there is a long journey from now until that final. Step by step, we try to move in the right direction.\"\n\nThat pursuit of the Champions League is the chief reason why Diaz is in Bavaria. There is no denying that Bayern proved themselves capable of punishing weaker opposition under Vincent Kompany but there are still question marks against the stronger sides.\nThey were knocked out of the cup by Bayer Leverkusen and beaten by Barcelona long before Inter ousted them from the Champions League. They drew two Klassikers against Borussia Dortmund and lost both Club World Cup games against European opposition.\nThere is a suspicion that they need to up the work rate if they are to come out on top in those games, adding energy on and off the ball. It was interesting that even though Diaz was clearly still getting up to speed, this was the specific quality being cited in Stuttgart.\nBayern's sporting director Christoph Freund told reporters afterwards: \"You could see how hard-working he is. I think that is a very important point over the whole season, that he is a player who works very, very hard and can still do decisive things up front.\"\nPerhaps Bayern will still need more. Kane himself hinted at some of the challenges. \"It has been a short pre-season. We have had to get a lot of stuff done in a short space of time.\" He was even unusually candid about the requirement for more new signings.\n\"It is one of the smallest squads I have probably played in. There is still time from now until the end of the transfer window. We have a couple of really good young players who have done well in the pre-season games, but we are a little light, if we are being honest.\n\"We are going to need everyone. With the squad we have, everyone is going to play, everyone is going to get opportunities. There are going to be moments where each individual has to step up and show what they can do.\" Luis Diaz, of course, already has.",

        "title": "Scottish Premiership transfers: What does your club still need to add before deadline day?",
        "content": "The Scottish Premiership transfer window closes on September 1, but who does your club still need to add?\nIt has not been another flying start for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership, losing their first two games without scoring.\nJimmy Thelin has made nine signings so far, two on loan, with Marko Lazetic from AC Milan his latest.\n\nA striker was top of the Dons' need list. Their top scorer last season was loanee Kevin Nisbet - his departure, as well as not replacing Bojan Miovski when he left last summer, meant there was a shortage up top.\nKusini Yengi has also arrived at Pittodrie following his departure from Portsmouth, but it has been a tough start for the Australia international, who didn't score a competitive goal last season.\nThelin will be hoping Kenan Bilalovic's arrival helps fill the void left by Jamie McGrath and Leighton Clarkston's move to a deeper role, while another left-back would free up captain Graeme Shinnie for his role in midfield.\n\nBrendan Rodgers' side have made a winning start to their Premiership title defence but with a European campaign ahead, there is work to do before deadline day.\nIt is in the attacking areas that Celtic are most lacking as they aim to qualify for Europe's elite competition again.\nWinger Nicolas Kuhn left for Como earlier this month, and options have been limited after talisman Kyogo Furuhashi left in January.\nJota is expected to miss a large spell of this campaign, meaning another injury to the likes of Daizen Maeda or James Forrest would leave Hyun-Jun Yang and Marco Tilio - the latter with just two Hoops appearances before loan spells - as Rodgers' options.\n\nBenjamin Nygren can play as a wide player, but is favoured through the middle, meaning direct competition for Arne Engles.\nWhile Adam Idah is Rodgers' preferred frontman, he is yet to score this season. Callum Osmand has been brought in as one for the future, meaning Jonny Kenny and new signing Shin Yamada - both relatively untested - are his back-up options for that position.\nSteven Pressley has already said it's \"critical\" that Dundee add to their squad before the end of the transfer window but admits some targets have preferred moves to other clubs.\nThe new Dens Park boss insists his squad is far short of what is needed for the challenges ahead this season and it is essential that he increases his options.\nDundee are already out of the League Cup, but did hold Rangers to a draw at Ibrox to pick up their first point of the Scottish Premiership campaign.\nA host of players left at the end of last season, including Lyall Cameron, Joe Shaughnessy and Josh Mulligan. While nine have arrived, including Yan Dhanda from Hearts, Pressley will want more with his squad light in a number of areas.\nThe transfer window is still open, but Jim Goodwin has already had to defend his summer signing policy with no Scottish players moving to Tannadice Park.\nHe insists he tried for home-grown players, but they went elsewhere for more money and the United Academy will always be a major feeder for his team.\nThere is no doubt the club have a Sam Dalby-shaped hole to fill with the striker scoring 15 league goals while on loan from Wrexham last season. While Zac Sapsford has impressed early on in his Dundee United career, he is set to be out for four weeks with an injury suffered in Europe. So, could Goodwin move for another forward before the window shuts?\nHe has also been boosted by the return of Liverpool's Luca Stephenson. The defender was named the club's young player of the year last season, and fans will hope he can impress again during this campaign, after agreeing a loan deal at the club.\nJohn McGlynn wanted to show loyalty to the players who secured promotion for Falkirk, a decision which could prove costly this season.\nJust four players have joined the Scottish Premiership newcomers so far and the Bairns have taken just one point from their opening two games.\nDefensive errors have proved costly, so can McGlynn strengthen at the back before they come up against even tougher opposition this season?\nBrian Graham and Scott Arfield were his only viable attacking options on the bench in their defeat at Livingston last time out - that's a duo with a combined age of 73, so you would expect him to be looking for a younger option to add to the ranks as well.\n\nDerek McInnes has made a blistering league start at Hearts, boosted by the addition of nine summer signings.\nWith strikers Claudio Braga and Elton Kabangu joining, plus captain Lawrence Shankland signing a new deal in the summer - Hearts don't need more new forwards.\nHowever, could they look to strengthen at the other end, including a goalkeeper - with Craig Gordon still injured?\nWhile McInnes may have got the bulk of his incomings secured, he will still look to trim his squad in areas, with around 30 players in his first-team ranks.\nThe Jambos have been proactive with new shareholder Tony Bloom intent on using shrewd data-based recruitment to crack Celtic and Rangers' duopoly of the Scottish top flight, and eventually help Hearts to their first league title since 1960.\nAfter years of turmoil at Easter Road, Hibs now appear to be very much on the up.\nDavid Gray has the side on the verge of securing European football until Christmas and they're also through to the League Cup quarter-finals.\nProgression to the Conference League could see the head coach handed a transfer boost for some late signings to cope with the challenge of European football.\nHibs have already broken their transfer record this summer to sign Togo international striker Thibault Klidje from Luzern. Gray has told the fans to be \"patient\" with him, but he's already off the mark, scoring the opener in their League Cup win against St Johnstone.\nAs well as big money moves, Hibs have also been shrewd in their business by adding Josh Mulligan and Jamie McGrath on free, plus the experienced Grant Hanley.\nStuart Kettlewell seems to have a clear vision for Kilmarnock and there has been a huge squad overhaul since he took charge in May.\nHe did lose a lot of quality with the likes of Bobby Wales, Danny Armstrong and Corrie Ndaba leaving, but he has added 12 players, with 11 of them on permanent deals.\n\nTeenager Ben Brannan's also been a revelation while playing out of position - the defender has already netted a goal-of-the-season contender.\nCould his new freedom in midfield see Kettlewell look to further strengthen his back line before September 1?\nLivingston's transfer business looked all but done, with David Martindale strengthening his squad for their top-flight return.\nHe added 14 new players, with a mix of Scottish Premiership experience and youth, as he took advantage of the club's new ownership and the ability to add more players.\nMartindale then wanted to trim his group to around 23 players. However, it looks like he will need to make further signings.\nNew arrival Aidan Denholm faces months out with a hamstring injury, while Celtic loanee Adam Montgomery, Danny Wilson and Graham Carey have all picked up knocks.\nHe is also without the likes of Cammy Kerr for a long period, meaning midfield and defence will be areas Martindale will look to strengthen over the coming weeks.\nThey have taken four points from their opening Premiership games and, although out of the League Cup, the manager should be encouraged by what his new-look squad are offering so far.\n\nIt has been a summer of change at Motherwell with Jens Berthel Askou losing one of his top young talents just weeks after taking charge of the club.\nLennon Miller left for Udinese for a club record fee of £4.7m and the manager is well aware that not all of that will be available to him for transfers.\nNew loan signing Eseosa Soule has returned to West Brom for rehab, with the club moving quickly to add Esapa Osong on a season-long loan from Nottingham Forrest as a replacement for the injured striker.\nBerthel has nine new players in, a number needed with 10 returning to their parent clubs at the end of last season after loan spells in North Lanarkshire. It is fair to say he will expect a few more to arrive before September 1.\nNew head coach Russell Martin has brought in 10 new players, plus Oscar Cortes' deal became permanent after his loan at Ibrox last season.\nSo what else might happen over the next fortnight? Well, you'd imagine a striker and defender are most likely to still be on the summer wishlist.\nDanilo, Cyriel Dessers and Hamza Igamane have all featured to varying extents at the top end of the pitch - but all have struggled for consistency and suffered with injuries.\nIn defence, Rangers have added centre-backs Nasser Djiga and Emmanuel Fernandez, plus full-backs Jayden Meghoma and Max Aarons.\nHowever, with Jefte set to depart and the likes of Ridvan Yilmaz, Ben Davies and Leon King being allowed to leave - Martin will want more cover for his back-line.\nGers chiefs did say the Rangers squad rebuild would not be complete after just one window - but Martin will still hope for a few more faces before this one closes. If they are to qualify for the Champions League, he'd hope to have more money to spend in the closing days of the window.\nStephen Robinson had targeted six new signings this summer, a figure he has already surpassed as he aims for another top-six finish.\nA total of 12 new players have arrived in Paisley, with Killian Phillips and Roland Idowu joining on permanent deals after impressing on loan.\nKeanu Baccus has returned to his \"home away from home\" after re-joining the Buddies just over a year after leaving for Mansfield Town and Robinson believes he now has \"arguably one of the best midfields in the league\".\nIt's fair to say he would still like to add a striker to his squad before deadline day but either way, the Saints boss appears to have strengthened a side that narrowly missed out on European football.",

        "content": "Bournemouth have completed the signing of teenage winger Ben Gannon Doak from Liverpool for around £25m.\nSky Sports News understands the deal for the 19-year-old includes a buy-back option, which was an essential condition for Liverpool to agree to the transfer.\nThe Scotland international, who wishes to be known as Gannon Doak to reflect both of his parents' names, has signed a five-year deal at the Vitality Stadium.\n\nSky Sports News understands Gannon Doak is viewed by Bournemouth as a replacement for Luis Sinisterra , who is set to join Brazilian side Cruzeiro on loan.\nThe south coast club sold forward Dango Ouattara to Brentford for £42.5m and they are looking at Bayer Leverkusen's Amine Adli and FC Midtjylland winger Dario Osorio as targets to replace Ouattara.\nMeanwhile, Gannon Doak's sale means Liverpool have now sold eight players this summer for a combined total of £227.6m, having spent £321m on new signings.\n\nSky Sports News reported earlier in the window that Doak was seeking regular first-team football this season.\nIt is understood Porto had made a bid for Doak earlier this summer, with Stuttgart , Bologna and Monaco among the other European clubs eyeing a move for the teenager.\nA host of Premier League clubs, including Nottingham Forest , West Ham , Leeds , Everton and Wolves, were also interested in the Scotland international this summer.\nLiverpool rejected bids of around £20m from Crystal Palace and Ipswich in the January transfer window.\nDoak spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, scoring three goals and adding seven assists in 24 Championship appearances before an injury in January cut his season short.\n\nGannon Doak could make his Bournemouth debut on Saturday at home in the Premier League against Wolves and he will wear the number 11 shirt.\nHe said: \"I'm buzzing to be here. I feel like it's the right time for me, and it's a great opportunity to play regular football at the highest level. It feels like the perfect fit.\n\"The team play very nice football. It's fast and it really suits my game, so I felt like I couldn't say no to the chance to play here.\"\nGannon Doak is the Cherries’ fourth summer signing, taking the club's spending to just under £100m following the arrivals of goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic , left-back Adrien Truffert and centre-back Bafode Diakite .\n\nTiago Pinto, the club's Head of Football Operations, said: \"Ben is an exciting young talent who has shown his quality at the highest level despite his age.\n\"﻿He brings pace and energy that will fit our model well, and we're thoroughly looking forward to helping him fulfil his potential at AFC Bournemouth.\n\"﻿We're pleased to bring another player into the club during this window as we continue to reinvest in the squad.\"\n\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Liverpool influence at Man City? Jamie Carragher explains how former Jurgen Klopp assistant Pep Lijnders may be impacting Pep Guardiola",
        "content": "Man City's 4-0 win at Wolves showed they are up for a Premier League title chase - but the way they did it had Jamie Carragher wondering whether Pep Guardiola's fresh approach has been influenced by Liverpool.\nAfter City dropped off their usual standards last term, Guardiola brought in Pep Lijnders as assistant coach, Jurgen Klopp's former deputy at Liverpool.\nWith City playing an offside trap at Molineux and scoring on the counter-attack, Carragher believes Lijnders \"is having a big influence on Guardiola\", noting the similarities with the style Lijnders and Klopp favoured during their time together at Anfield.\nDefensively, Man City repeatedly pushed up to try to catch Wolves offside - and did just that when Marshall Munetsi headed in during the first half. That plan was even executed close to the halfway line, with City's backline stepping right up high as Wolves tried to play the ball forwards.\n\"I couldn't believe what I saw, the players were all jumping high up to try and catch the Wolves players offside,\" said Carragher told Monday Night Football.\n\"This is very Liverpool-like. It made me think how much influence is maybe the new coach having on this team.\"\nWhether it was Liverpool-inspired or not, fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville applauded the performance of Man City's defence to keep such a disciplined line.\n\"It's really good play,\" he added. \"To get a back-four unit in sync like that, it takes some doing. It's really good play from [centre-back] John Stones.\"\n\nCarragher also noted similarities between City's performance with Liverpool's threat on the break under Klopp.\nTijjani Reijnders' goal came from a swift move up the field, with Guardiola making a point of celebrating with Lijnders in the aftermath.\n\"The amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohamed] Salah, breaking forward,\" said Carragher. \"When I looked at the goal from Reijnders… not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal.\n\"Of course, Pep Guardiola's teams have scored plenty of counter-attacking goals in the past. But what really stood out for this one was the type of goal it was. They win it and then they're off.\n\"Lijnders - Guardiola gives him the thanks, the hug. Now we don't know exactly what that's for, but I don't think it's a coincidence with some of the things that I saw in the game that he, as a coach, is having a big influence on Pep Guardiola.\"\nAfterwards, Guardiola himself said City were trying to be better with attacking breaks than they were last season.\n\"It's a weapon that we want to use this season - when we're getting the ball, attack quicker than maybe before.\"\nWhether it is a Liverpool inspiration from Lijnders or not, it seems clear Guardiola has once again reimagined his Man City side.\nCarragher says the serial winner recognised the shift in style in the Premier League away from controlled, patient build-up into a more dynamic approach - and has responded.\n\"What Pep said last season, when he was talking about where the game was going, he was actually saying, 'it's not really my football', the football that was seen of teams in the Premier League. Transition, end-to-end football.\n\n\"I think he mentioned Brentford, he was talking about Bournemouth, he wasn't just talking about the real top teams. How many teams in the Premier League were playing like that.\"\nCity have shown they can have success playing that way too. After learning from their rivals, they look like they will be serious contenders for the Premier League crown once again. That's a view shared by Neville.\n\"Watching that game on Saturday, it was a little bit, 'Oh, did we just forget about the obvious?' Pep Guardiola, if he loses a title, he'll win it back,\" said Neville.\n\"He wins titles nearly every single year he's coached in his career, and when you saw Reijnders on Saturday, you think of Rodri to come back in, you think of Stones and [Ruben] Dias, [Erling] Haaland up front... that's a spine and a half, that's a title-winning spine, it's a treble-winning spine with a manager who's prolific.\n\"City, just off what we've seen on Saturday, if they keep their players fit, they could be really in business.\"",

        "title": "Morecambe latest news: Ashvir Singh Johal named new Shrimps manager",
        "content": "Ashvir Singh Johal has been named the new manager of Morecambe, becoming the first Sikh to take charge of a professional British club.\nThe 30-year-old replaced Derek Adams, who was sacked on Monday, just a day after new owners Punjab Warriors completed the takeover which saved the club from extinction.\nSky Sports News understands new Morecambe owners Panjab Warriors had intended to appoint him in the summer but were delayed by the protracted sale of the club from Jason Whittingham's Bond Group.\nA Morecambe statement said: \"Ashvir Singh Johal arrives at the Mazuma Mobile Stadium with an excellent reputation as a forward-thinking coach and leader, bringing with him a wealth of experience in player development, tactical innovation, and building high-performance cultures.\n\"His appointment marks an exciting new era for the Shrimps as the club continues its journey under fresh ownership and renewed ambition.\"\nSingh Johal worked closely with Kolo Toure when the pair were coaching under Brendan Rodgers at Leicester City. He went on to join the former Ivory Coast international at Wigan as first-team coach when Toure was appointed as the club's manager almost three years ago.\nSky Sports News exclusively revealed that the move to Wigan had made Singh Johal the first Sikh to take up a frontline coaching role in Sky Bet Championship history.\nSingh Johal, who holds a UEFA Pro Licence, later had a spell as assistant coach to Cesc Fabregas at Como's academy in Italy and he now has a hefty in-tray at Morecambe, starting with building a squad as he currently only has five players under contract.\nMorecambe, who were relegated from Sky Bet League Two last season, have had their first two National League games postponed after being suspended for failing to comply with the league's rules.\nSingh Johal is due to be in the dugout as Morecambe are scheduled to open their campaign against Altrincham, though that game could also be in doubt given the club's current lack of players.\nDespite the uncertainty of the immediate future, the new boss is looking to the long term.\n\"The immediate priority right now is going to be to identify the players that we need in this building to ensure Morecambe Football Club can perform well in the National League,\" he said in an interview with the club's official website.\n\"I think the short-term plan this year is to make sure that we retain our place in the National League by playing exciting, energetic football and working hard. I think that is a short-term aim.\n\"The long-term aim is to build the processes, the infrastructure. There's a clear commitment from the owners about the direction they want the club to go in.\n\"OK, now it's about building, and it's about growing and making sure that in three, four, five years' time, this is a completely energised and galvanised more football club that thrives in the EFL.\"\nAt 30, Singh Johal, who never played professional football and worked his way up the coaching ranks with a 10-year stint at Leicester, is one of the youngest coaches to earn the UEFA Pro Licence. He left Notts County in the summer where he was their B Team head coach.\nOn becoming a first-team manager for the first time, he added: \"It's what I've wanted to do. It's been my dream since I was 14 or 15 years old.\n\"It's every single day that's been the target I've worked towards. But for me, now there's a new target, and the target is to make sure Morecambe is successful as a club.\n\"Make sure this year we don't just survive in the National League, we thrive.\"\nAnti-discrimination charity Kick It Out applauded Singh Johal's appointment.\nIt said in a post on X: \"History made. Congratulations to Ashvir Singh Johal on becoming the first Sikh manager in professional football.\n\"Fully deserved and also a significant milestone for representation in leadership within the game.\"",

        "title": "Paul Merson says: Advantage Arsenal after 'vital' win but Man City's performance a warning",
        "content": "Paul Merson gives his verdict on the opening weekend of the season, including a \"vital\" win for Arsenal at Man Utd and Man City's \"impressive\" rout of Wolves.\nIn his exclusive column for skysports.com , the Magic Man also gives his thoughts on United's goalkeeper issues, Tottenham's start under Thomas Frank and Chelsea's lack of cutting edge in front of goal...\n\nThe name of the game is winning.\nOld Trafford is a difficult place to go, especially on the opening weekend, but Arsenal found a way to win.\nThey will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.\nIt was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.\n\nBut advantage Arsenal. The way I see it now is Liverpool and Man City have to go to Old Trafford to win to match Arsenal, and that's a huge positive at such an early stage of the season.\nSpecial mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.\nThere were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.\nIf he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.\n\nNo-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.\nIt's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.\nThe win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.\nI know it wasn't the hardest game in Wolves, but winning away from home 4-0 on the opening day of the Premier League is no mean feat.\nIt was the result of the weekend for me because no-one on Soccer Saturday mentioned them as title winners. Everyone is on Liverpool or Arsenal but the performance from City was a wake-up call for everyone.\nThere will be bigger tests to come for them, that's for sure, starting on Saturday against Spurs, but they were very impressive.\nIt is rare in football that a club wins a league title, a Champions League, a Euros or a World Cup without a solid goalkeeper.\nYou have to have a good goalkeeper because they save you points. David Raya won Arsenal points on Sunday, Alisson Becker does it continually for Liverpool and Ederson has done it through the years at Man City.\nAltay Bayindir has lost Man Utd points already with that error against Arsenal. It was a big mistake, a critical mistake in the end.\n\nI can't emphasise how important a top goalkeeper is to a football club and Man Utd have to now react before the transfer window closes.\nApart from that error, Man Utd did alright against Arsenal.\nI was impressed with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo but there is still plenty they need to work on to improve as a cohesive unit.\nAdd in a fit and firing Benjamin Sesko and they will definitely cause plenty of teams problems, but there is still plenty to solve for Ruben Amorim.\nThey played as well as they could against Arsenal but still lost the game. That's not the best sign for a team.\nI still can't see them not being around the middle of the table come the end of the season without further improvement before the transfer window closes.\n\nChelsea were not good against Crystal Palace. The draw was worrying.\nIf Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea.\nPalmer is now the talk of the town in team talks up against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea. Stop Cole Palmer will be the message for West Ham on Friday. That's just how it is.\nHe needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.\nBut he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.\nIt's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.\nIt's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.\nYou cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.\n\nI'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.\nThat was a must-win game against Burnley. I expected it to be a bit tighter so credit to Spurs for that, but it would have been a shock had they not got all three points at the weekend.\nIt was a good result, but the acid test is still to come. Let's see how they perform at Man City at the weekend and then we can start to make a judgement.\nPeople were going mad about the PSG performance but there's still a long way to go for Spurs.\n\nIt wasn't hard for Thomas Frank to change things up considering what came before. Ange Postecoglou's Spurs were so open, as open as you can ever seem from a football manager and team, so it wasn't going to take much to adjust.\nYou don't need to be Albert Einstein to work out how to play against PSG. You need as many defenders as you can on the pitch. Then, against Burnley, you need as many attackers on the pitch as you can to keep causing them problems.\nA lot of Tottenham fans have been on already saying this is it, but the acid test is against Man City this weekend and he can set up to stop Pep Guardiola's side playing.",

        "title": "Michelle Agyemang: Lionesses forward rejoins Brighton on loan from Arsenal",
        "content": "Michelle Agyemang is returning to Brighton on loan from Arsenal.\nAgyemang - who was a star for England at Euro 2025 - enjoyed a successful first spell at Brighton last season, scoring five goals in 22 appearances. But Arsenal have fierce competition for forward spots this season with the likes of Alessia Russo, Beth Mead, Caitlin Foord and Stina Blackstenuis, in their playing ranks - as well as new £1m summer signing Olivia Smith from Liverpool.\nSo Agyemang will spend the next campaign on the south coast for consistent minutes and playing time.\nAgyemang played a key role in England's triumph at the Women's Euros. The 19 year old scored twice in four appearances, including crucial late equalisers in the quarter-final and semi-final, and was subsequently named Young Player of the Tournament.\nArsenal's director of women's football Clare Wheatley praised Agyemang's progress and explained the reasoning behind the move: \"We're so proud of Michelle's achievements this summer and throughout her journey at Arsenal, from her first steps in our academy through to our first-team squad.\n\"After discussing closely with Michelle and her family, we have all agreed that this move will provide Michelle with a further opportunity to develop and grow, as she continues to progress as a young player and person.\n\"We wish Michelle every success at Brighton and look forward to welcoming her back to Arsenal at the end of her loan.\"\nAgyemang will now look to build on her breakout year as she begins her second spell with Brighton, with the Seagulls kicking off their WSL campaign against Aston Villa on September 7th, live on Sky Sports.\nSky Sports News' Anton Toloui:\nIt may seem surprising that one of the stars of the Euros is going out on loan but Arsenal are playing the long game.\nIf Michelle Agyemang had stayed at Arsenal she'd be behind Alessia Russo and Stina Blackstenuis and so keeping her to sit on the bench would offer short-term insurance but at the cost her of development.\nThat development has been beyond rapid. She'd only started one WSL match before scoring on her England debut in April and a summer of training and playing with the best in the country proved she's England's present as well as future.\nNow Agyemang goes back to a club and coach that know her well, where she'll be the starting No.9 and where she already has a connection with the fan base.\nThe only way this comes back to haunt Arsenal if their incumbent strikers suffer injury or a lack of form. They're sticking to the plan that Agyemang will take over from Blackstenius next season.\nFor the ever-ambitious Brighton, they've got one of the continent's top young players to help boost their WSL ambitions.\nSky Sports will be embarking on a new five-year partnership with the WSL, showing 90 per cent of all Women's Super League matches from the 2025/26 season.\nReigning champions Chelsea will be aiming to secure a record-extending seventh straight WSL title - but they will likely face a major challenge from European champions Arsenal , who have made a summer statement by signing Liverpool's Smith as the first £1m player in women's football.\nThe two Manchester sides City and United will be hoping to compete as well, with City, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur among the clubs beginning new eras with new managers.",

But there's been so many names floated about. I wouldn't disclose either way.\"\n\nThe transfer window closes on September 1, with Hoops fans frustrated by the lack of new signings while some players could also still leave Parkhead.\n\"There's so much noise, especially as it ramps up towards the end,\" the Northern Irishman added.\n\"I've been in enough changing rooms to know how stability can be lost in this moment, because some players will be thinking, are they staying, are they going?\n\"But in the midst of that, you've got really important games.\n\"I've already mentioned this to players a number of weeks back, and respecting and acknowledging that it is a difficult part of the season.\n\"However, the money will be in your bank every month and it'll be from Celtic, whilst you need to perform so you don't need to worry about anything else.\n\"I respect and acknowledge that it can be tough, especially, are you going to be here or are you not?\n\"But Celtic pay your wages, and while they do, you focus on doing the very best you can for Celtic.\"\nCeltic captain Callum McGregor believes the club should only add new signings that will improve the squad.\n\"Everyone is impatient in football,\" he said.\n\"Everybody wants the next new shiny thing and that's just where we are.

        "title": "Alexander Isak transfer news: Liverpool target breaks silence to declare he 'can't continue' at Newcastle",
        "content": "Liverpool target Alexander Isak says his relationship with Newcastle \"can't continue\" and \"change is in the best interests of everyone\" as he accused the club of broken promises over his future.\nHours after the striker delivered his bombshell statement, Newcastle responded by refuting Isak's suggestion he was told he could leave this summer and insisted they \"do not foresee\" the player being sold, as their terms are unlikely to be met.\nIsak's potential sale has always been dependent on Newcastle signing an adequate replacement and a club meeting their £150m valuation. With less than two weeks left in the window, neither of those conditions have been met.\nIsak, 25, is currently training away from his team-mates, and arrived at the Newcastle United training ground just after 3pm on Wednesday, the day after he posted the statement on social media.\nNewcastle added in their reply: \"Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his team-mates.\"\nIsak's explosive statement said: \"I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors.\n\n\"The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading.\n\"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue. That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.\"\nNewcastle's statement in response read: \"We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views.\n\"As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take into consideration the best interests of Newcastle United, the team and our supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a sale this summer have not transpired.\n\"We do not foresee those conditions being met.\n\"This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive to retain our family feel. Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his teammates.\"\nSky Sports News reported in July that Isak had informed Newcastle he wanted to explore his options this transfer window.\nAt the start of August, Liverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid rejected by Newcastle for the 25-year-old.\nIsak took his frustrations public on Tuesday with an update on Instagram posted during the PFA awards ceremony, which he skipped despite being nominated for the top prize of Player of the Year, due to his current stand-off with Newcastle.\nHe said: \"I'm proud to be recognised by my fellow professionals with a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Season for 2024/25.\n\"First and foremost I want to thank my teammates and everyone at Newcastle United who has supported me along the way.\n\"I'm not at the ceremony tonight. With everything going on, it didn't feel right to be there.\"\nNewcastle have so far failed to bring in a striker to cover the loss of Callum Wilson let alone Isak.\nThey have been unsuccessful this summer with attempts to sign Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko - both of whom were considered potential successors to Isak - and have very limited options with less than two weeks left of the window.\nNewcastle had a £25m bid rejected for Yoane Wissa earlier in the window, but made a new bid worth £35m plus add-ons on Wednesday.\nWissa is viewed by Newcastle as a second-choice striker and his potential arrival would likely not help Isak get his move.\nOther than Isak, Newcastle currently only have one recognised striker on their books in 22-year-old William Osula, who did not start a single Premier League game for the club last season.\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\n\"Newcastle are stressing here that they have been unable to find a suitable replacement for Alexander Isak, coupled by Liverpool's opening bid falling significantly below the striker's valuation.\n\"Had Newcastle managed to sign Hugo Ekitike or Benjamin Sesko, who joined Liverpool and Manchester United respectively, then in all likelihood the club would have reluctantly sold Isak to Liverpool with an increased bid from the Premier League champions.\n\"Newcastle have tried hard to facilitate and give Isak his wish, but they cannot leave themselves without a recognised striker.\n\"Unless something out of the blue comes up between now and the window closing on September 1, it appears Isak will be staying. If and when he plays again is another story…\"\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:\n\"Newcastle talked last night about the conditions of a sale.\n\"There were two conditions.\n\"One, the valuation of the player is £150m.\n\"That is what Newcastle's valuation is. I still think they would probably do a deal for a little bit less than that. But I think Liverpool's £110m offer that landed a few weeks ago is way short. So if Liverpool were to really seriously want Isak, they would have to come to the table with a higher bid.\n\"The second is that Newcastle need to find a replacement. They tried on Benjamin Sesko, they tried on Hugo Ekitike, failed on both of those.\n\"They're actually even struggling right now, as we can see, to bring in a replacement for Callum Wilson, who left on a free contract. We've been telling you for weeks now that they've been trying to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford. But he's seen as the Callum Wilson replacement rather than the Alexander Isak replacement.\n\"So they can't even get the second striker in, if you like.\n\"If they were able to land Wissa in the next few days - and I am expecting a bid in the next couple of days - and Liverpool came to the table offering £130m then Newcastle might have a decision to make.\n\"However, it would leave them very light on striker reinforcements.\"\n\nJuly 15: Liverpool told Isak not for sale in this window after making informal approach to Newcastle - and decide to rival them for Hugo Ekitike instead after being rebuffed.\nJuly 19: Eddie Howe reveals after pre-season friendly defeat at Celtic that Isak travelled with the rest of the squad to Glasgow but he chose to send him home \"due to the speculation around him\".\nJuly 23: Liverpool beat Newcastle to the signing of Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt after the North East club had already missed out on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro.\nJuly 24: Isak is not included in Newcastle's squad for pre-season tour of Asia due to what Newcastle described as a \"minor thigh injury\".\nJuly 24: It later emerges that Isak has informed Newcastle he wants to explore his options in this transfer window.\nJuly 31: Sky Sports News reports that Isak is training individually at former club Real Sociedad's facilities.\nAugust 1: Newcastle reject an official bid from Liverpool for Isak worth £110m plus add-ons.\nAugust 2: Newcastle make formal bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko worth nearly £70m and Isak later flies back to the North East after his personal training camp in Spain.\nAugust 4: The striker returns to Newcastle's training ground for the first time and has trained separately from his team-mates ever since.\nAugust 4: Newcastle up their offer to RB Leipzig for Sesko amid interest from Manchester United.\nAugust 8: Newcastle boss Eddie Howe says \"we would love the player to be with us\" about Isak after he misses friendly win over Espanyol at St James' Park.\nAugust 9: Manchester United beat Newcastle to the signing of Sesko despite their offer to RB Leipzig being lower.\nAugust 16: Isak not included in Newcastle squad for Premier League season opener against Aston Villa - but Howe says \"door is well and truly open\" for a return.\nAugust 19: Isak skips PFA awards and releases a statement on Instagram accusing Newcastle of broken promises, telling the club \"change is in the best interests of everyone\".\nAugust 19: Newcastle release a statement in response to Isak, denying that promises were made to allow Isak to leave and insisting they would welcome him back when he is \"ready to rejoin his team-mates\"\n\nSky Sports' Jamie Carragher speaking last week:\n\"I don't like the way he's going about it, and I don't think any football fan should.\n\"There is nothing wrong with wanting to leave a club, that's the nature of the game, players leave clubs every summer, but you work as hard as you can and play the games. You can say you want to leave, I understand the player's frustration and a bit of bitterness because of the money on offer, but I don't think you can get to the stage where you don't train.\n\"I'm not that fussed on Liverpool signing him. He's better than (Hugo) Ekitike right now. But it almost feels like what PSG or Real Madrid tried to do a few years ago, whereby they try to sign all the best players available. Liverpool don't do that. There are other areas Liverpool should use that money.\"\nSky Sports' Gary Neville speaking last week:\n\"Isak should be angry with his agent. It's unsavoury.\n\n\"I feel sorry for Eddie Howe. Isak wants to win trophies and is agitating for a move because he's got one career. I can see both sides. He's got five or six good years left.\n\"It looks like this guy is downing tools and saying he's not playing, and I don't think that is right.\n\"Newcastle have to stand strong here. If you're the club, it sends the wrong message to sell after what has happened.\n\"I think they have to keep him for another year because the precedent will be dangerous for Newcastle.\"",

        "title": "Johan Bakayoko interview: Jurgen Klopp persuaded me to join RB Leipzig after being linked to every club in the world",
        "content": "The catalyst for Johan Bakayoko's summer move to Leipzig was a conversation with Red Bull's head of global sport. \"When I had the talk with Jurgen Klopp, that was like the trigger point for me,\" he explains. \"Before, I wanted to go. But now, I have to go.\"\nBakayoko smiles when asked what exactly Klopp said to persuade him to leave PSV in Eindhoven and make the move to RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga. \"That was the most funny part of it,\" he says. \"We did not even talk about him wanting me to come.\"\nHe explains: \"It was really about football and what vision I have on football. He even told me, like, even if you go to some other club, then you have to do this to adapt better.\" The player appreciated not being given the hard sell, just being seen as a human being.\n\"I was thinking, if someone like this talks to you in these kind of ways and he wants to build a project and he wants you to be part of it, but he doesn't want to push you to be part of it, it gives you the freedom to express yourself. And that is everything I need.\"\nKlopp has long had that personal touch. It convinced Bakayoko. \"I do not want to feel like I am pressured in some way,\" he adds. \"I just want to feel like someone wants me to help his club.\"\nAnd Bakayoko is a player who can help. He has speed and skill, he scores goals and he entertains. Klopp will have seen his performance for PSV in their 3-2 win over Liverpool in the Champions League in January, a game in which Bakayoko scored the opening goal.\nPSV head coach Peter Bosz actually criticised his players for their showboating late in that game, suggesting it was disrespectful. Bakayoko was perhaps the chief culprit. But it is just how he sees the game. He is there to make a difference - and also have fun.\nSpeaking to him about that, he says: \"I think that is just a part of me. You expect me to do these kind of things. That is just the way I am. That is not even something I am thinking about doing. That is just something that happens naturally at this point.\n\"That is not something I am forcing [myself] to do, just because someone told me to do it, I am going to do it. For me, that is how I see football and the way I want to express myself on the pitch.\" A showman, then, but one who was mightily effective for PSV.\nDo not be fooled by his total of one assist in their Eredivisie title win last season. That owed much to the misses of others. Bakayoko ranked among the top 20 for chances created per 90 minutes and also scored nine goals of his own in the competition.\nLook at the scatter graph showing players who score goals and create chances for others and it highlights the fact that he was among the most decisive players in the Eredivisie. The next, plotting goals and dribbles, shows why he was so entertaining.\nBosz had to persuade Bakayoko to stay and be part of that title success. \"In my eyes, last season was also a great opportunity to leave. But if the club do not want me to leave, that is actually not the perfect time.\" There were \"a lot of talks\" between the pair.\n\"He wanted me to make the step at the right moment and, for him, last season was not the right moment. I thought it was. But if you have a good relationship with someone, you also do not want to disappoint them because he helped me a lot when he came.\"\nThe respect for Bosz is clear. \"He gave me the opportunity, he made me a better player.\" Bakayoko decided to do one more year. \"I took his advice really seriously and he said to me, 'It's not the right time, we still have a championship to win', So I stuck to the plan.\"\nThat plan has taken him to Leipzig despite interest from elsewhere. \"For the last three years, I think I was linked to every single club in the world, maybe.\" A Premier League move was mooted but Bakayoko wanted to find \"the right project\" and believes that he has.\nHe describes his main motivation as \"just to get better\" which might explain why he turned down a lucrative switch to Saudi Arabia. At 22 years old, there is certainly time for him to add much more to his game and he clearly has the mentality to make it happen.\nHe takes visualisation seriously, using the technique to help him prepare. \"It can be everything from my decision-making to the shooting, to the passing, to go one-v-one or give a pass. It can be everything and I try to visualise and to perfect it,\" he explains.\n\"What can happen in the game for me, for my position? What could I have done better in the last games? I also start to see new solutions in my game, what I can improve, where I am lacking some things, where I am already good and where I can be better.\"\nBakayoko favours the right flank but ever since his early days in Belgium, he has been flexible. \"I played as the 10 and I played also on the left side and it was quite good so I think I am capable of doing it.\" The hope is that Leipzig coach Ole Werner can help him develop.\nAt just 37, Werner is a new breed of coach. Bakayoko describes him as \"someone with a completely new aspect of the game\" - a breath of fresh air. \"He is like a young player coming into a new team. He has the same mentality, the same hunger.\" An ideal fit for Leipzig.\nLeipzig are not in Europe this season for the first time since they won promotion to the Bundesliga almost a decade ago, but perhaps that offers the chance for a fresh start for the club, the opportunity to build a new team - with players like Bakayoko at its heart.\n\"The base is really there. You see the quality is really there. The hunger to achieve things is really there. The qualities of the coaches is really there. The staff is really there.\" He adds: \"The project for me was actually perfect. A club that really wanted me to grow.\"\nA club that really wanted him, full stop. On Friday, he makes his Bundesliga debut at Bayern Munich. \"I feel excited. I am used to big games, but this is a completely different environment.\" An environment that he just had to be part of because of Jurgen Klopp.",

        "content": "Kai Havertz is currently being assessed over a knee injury\nThe German was absent from Arsenal's open training session put on for the fans at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.\nHavertz has only just returned from a long-term hamstring injury which kept him out between February and May.\nThe club are assessing the situation and are waiting for the injury to settle before further analysis.\nJust days ago, the topic of debate was which striker out of Havertz or Viktor Gyokeres should start in Arsenal's big game against Liverpool next week. \"I think Mikel Arteta will go back to Havertz in the big games,\" said Jamie Carragher. \"I would be very surprised if Havertz doesn't play.\"\nNow it seems that the decision has been taken out of Arteta's hands.\nNo matter the severity of this Havertz knee injury, the German will be a major doubt for the trip to Anfield - placing a huge focus on Gyokeres in the first big game of his Arsenal career.\nBut once again, Arsenal are talking about injuries after it derailed them last season. Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka all missed over a dozen league matches due to injury last term - only the latter is fully fit at the start of this one.\nArsenal do know that Mikel Merino can fill in as an emergency option but that was an awkward scenario last season which Arteta and the Arsenal team made the most of. Playing the Spaniard as a No 9 again is a situation they want to avoid, if possible.\nWhat this situation does tell us, though, is that Arsenal will have to get Gyokeres on song soon, after a slightly underwhelming Premier League debut at Manchester United last weekend.\n\nSaturday's game against Leeds - which Gyokeres will almost certainly start now - is important in the early context of Arsenal's season. Goals are needed.\nAugust 23: Leeds (H), Premier League, kick-off 5.30pm, live on Sky Sports\nAugust 31: Liverpool (A), Premier League, kick-off 4.30pm, live on Sky Spotrs\nSeptember 13: Nottingham Forest (H), Premier League, kick-off 12.30pm\nSeptember 16-18: First Champions League fixture\nSeptember 21: Manchester City (H), Premier League, kick-off 4.30pm, live on Sky Sports\nSeptember 28: Newcastle (A), Premier League, kick-off 4.30pm, live on Sky Sports\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Real Madrid have world's most valuable squad but where do Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal rank?",
        "content": "Which clubs have the most valuable squads in the world?\nBetween the Lines returns with a breakdown of the top eight, according to Transfermarkt valuations , including analysis and insight into the how and why.\nSo, can anyone match the superstars of Real Madrid in terms of value? And do Arsenal really have the highest-value squad among Premier League clubs? Read on to find out.\nDespite a club-record low 15th-placed Premier League finish last season, Manchester United have the eighth-most valuable squad in the world at £766m, according to Transfermarkt .\nHaving added Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko to their attack this summer, almost half of that figure comes from their forward players, who are valued at a combined £352m.\nThe new signings offered glimpses of how they could transform Ruben Amorim's attack in Sunday's narrow defeat to Arsenal but there is still a need for more quality elsewhere in the squad.\nSky Sports pundit Gary Neville said they \"unequivocally\" need to sign a new goalkeeper. Their current options, Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton, are valued at only £29m.\nTheir midfielders, meanwhile, have less than half the value of their forwards, at £158m, further emphasising the need to bring other parts of their squad up to the level of their front line.\nLiverpool were outstanding in winning the Premier League title last season under Arne Slot but they have to settle for seventh place in the most valuable squads list.\nFlorian Wirtz has added a huge chunk of value following his arrival from Bayer Leverkusen for a British record £116.5m. Transfermarkt value the 22-year-old slightly higher than that, at £121m. But many of Liverpool's existing key players are declining in value due to age.\nMohamed Salah was valued at a high of £130.8m earlier in his Liverpool career but at 33, despite producing his best season yet last term and signing a new contract, his value is down at £43m.\nLike Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alisson Becker and Andrew Robertson, aged 34, 32 and 31 respectively, have also declined in value as Liverpool continue their work to refresh their squad, and increase its value, through recruitment this summer and beyond.\nLALIGA champions Barcelona come in at sixth, thanks in large part to their 18-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal, who ranks as the highest-value player in the world at £173m, meaning he accounts for 18 per cent of the squad's total value of £976m.\n\nBarcelona have another high-value asset in Pedri, who, like Yamal, is a product of their La Masia youth academy. The 22-year-old midfielder is valued at the same level as Liverpool's Wirtz at £121m.\nChelsea are the first of five clubs with a squad value of over £1bn.\nTheir high valuation is largely down to huge transfer spending by the club's owners, who have increased the value of their squad by signing young, high-potential signings. And a lot of them.\nSince the summer of 2022, Chelsea have spent nearly twice as much as any other Premier League club on transfers, their total of £1.52bn dwarfing the next-highest total of £861m, by Manchester United.\nThe total spent is far higher than the value of their current squad but it is worth noting Chelsea have made by far the most of any Premier League club in sales in the timeframe, allowing them to balance the books as they continue to reshape their squad in the interests of increasing its value, quality and potential.\nIt is only a year since Paris Saint-Germain lost their prized asset Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid but the club have gone from strength to strength, winning the Champions League last season and developing an extremely high-value squad under Luis Enrique.\nOusmane Dembele is now their main man but his Transfermarkt valuation of £77.7m is matched by two of his team-mates in Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who has thrived since joining from Napoli, and Desire Doue, who has emerged as one of the best young players in Europe.\nManchester City are rebuilding again under Pep Guardiola but their squad remains one of the most valuable in Europe at £1.12bn.\nThere is excitement about new recruits Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki after their goalscoring debuts in Saturday's 4-0 win over Wolves but the most valuable player in their squad, according to Transfermarkt , is unsurprisingly Erling Haaland.\nThe striker, who signed a new 10-year contract at the Etihad Stadium in January and has scored 126 goals in 147 games for the club, is valued at £155m by Transfermarkt , making him one of the most valuable players in the world.\nIt also makes him roughly £60m more valuable than any other Manchester City player, although Pep Guardiola's squad does contain numerous other high-value players, including six others valued at over £50m.\n\nIt is 21 years since Arsenal's last title win but their progress under Mikel Arteta is reflected by a soaring squad value which puts them second in the world and top among Premier League clubs.\nArsenal's squad has roughly doubled in value since Arteta's appointment in 2019, rising from around £540m to an all-time high of £1.14bn, thanks to an overhaul in personnel and an emphasis on youth typified by the talismanic Bukayo Saka, whose value has risen from £6m to £129.5m in the last six years.\nArsenal's squad planning has left them with a group of players who are mostly either in or approaching their peak years. Leandro Trossard and Christian Norgaard are their only outfielders over 30.\nTheir academy has played a huge role in building the value of their squad, first with Saka and now with Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly, who are valued at roughly £48m and £39m respectively at only 18 years old, with optimism that the 15-year-old Max Dowman could be next to follow Saka's footsteps.\nThe emergence of Saka, Nwaneri and Lewis-Skelly, all of whom cost the club nothing in transfer fees, has helped give Arsenal a Transfermarkt squad value £316m higher than its £826m cost.\nNo other Premier League club even comes close in terms of building value relative to squad cost, with Manchester United and Chelsea at the opposite end of the scale, their squad costs considerably higher than their current valuations, leaving them with negative differences.\nReal Madrid finished a disappointing season without silverware last term as Carlo Ancelotti made way for Xabi Alonso in the dugout, but it is no surprise to see them top for squad value at £1.21bn.\nTheir Galactico-filled squad features three of the five most valuable players in the world, with Jude Bellingham and Mbappe each valued at £155m - behind only Barcelona's Yamal (£173m) - while Vinicius Junior (£147m) is not far behind them and Haaland (also £155m).\nThey continue to target big names, with Trent Alexander-Arnold the latest superstar arrival, valued at £64.6m by Transfermarkt, while also signing leading young players such as Dean Huijsen, whose valuation of £51.7m is likely to grow at only 20, ensuring the squad is well placed to retain its value in the years ahead.\nBetween the Lines , a weekly Sky Sports strand revealing the data behind football's biggest stories, launched last week with a look at how the Opta and Sky Sports supercomputers' predicted Premier League tables compared. Surprises included!\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Newcastle's latest bid for Yoane Wissa has been rejected by Brentford.\nThe Magpies made the bid earlier on Wednesday, but it has now been turned down by their Premier League rivals.\nThe add-ons were understood to be worth up to a further £5m which could take the total to £40m. Newcastle had a £25m bid rejected by the Bees for Wissa earlier this summer.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Tottenham Hotspur were considering offering Richarlison in a deal for Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze. That would, in turn, have freed up striker space to try and sign Wissa, who played under Thomas Frank at Brentford.\nWissa still wants to join Newcastle.\nWissa was absent for Brentford's opening weekend fixture - a 3-1 defeat to Nottingham Forest - with Keith Andrews confirming his absence was linked to the speculation around the forward's future.\nThe west Londoners have already lost Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United for £71m, captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal and head coach Frank.\nThe 28-year-old was, however, seen in Brentford training on Tuesday. The Bees' next fixture is a home game against Aston Villa on Saturday at 3pm.\nThe pursuit of Wissa comes after more uncertainty regarding Alexander Isak 's future.\nThe Newcastle forward put out an explosive statement on Tuesday night regarding his transfer stand-off - saying his future with the Magpies \"cannot continue\" over \"broken promises\" made by the club.\n\nThis is after Liverpool saw a £110m bid rejected by Newcastle earlier this summer.\nIsak has not yet featured for Eddie Howe's side in matches since Newcastle returned to pre-season duty.

        "title": "Nick Woltemade to Bayern Munich: VfB Stuttgart’s unconventional striker has captured the imagination in Germany",
        "content": "The most talked about player in Germany right now is not Bayern Munich’s new signing Luis Diaz nor is it perennial top scorer Harry Kane. Both netted as Bayern won the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup but all eyes were on the striker still wearing a Stuttgart shirt.\nNick Woltemade is a target for Bayern after a fine first season at Stuttgart during which he scored 17 goals before going on to become the top scorer at the European Under-21 Championship in the summer. He made his senior debut for Germany just before that.\nSuch things do not go unnoticed at Bayern, as their former striker Claudio Pizarro explains. \"When a German player is doing well, then Bayern is like, 'Okay, the spotlight is out.'\" Woltemade was in that spotlight before, during and after Saturday's showpiece opener.\nDespite being denied a goal from close range by Manuel Neuer, he impressed. Dayot Upamecano, the physical Bayern centre-back, marked him closely but Woltemade showed that he was up for the fight, holding the ball up well for Stuttgart throughout.\n\"I have a feeling that Nick is very strong in times like this,\" says Atakan Karazor, his Stuttgart captain. But it is difficult to overstate the pressure on Woltemade in Germany right now. Stuttgart are holding firm but his agent keeps talking. And Bayern keep pushing.\nSpeaking to Jurgen Klinsmann, the former Germany international who made his name at Stuttgart before eventually going on to play for Bayern, there is nothing but empathy. \"It is a very logical sequence of thoughts that happens to you,\" Klinsmann explains.\n\"When a big team like Bayern Munich knocks at your door, there is a simple question that you have to ask yourself. Woltemade is probably sitting in his home or talking to his family or whoever he talks to. 'What if I don't do that? What happens if I don't do that?'\n\"I think the answer is already there. I think in every profession you want to do the best you can do. It is just in your human nature because you want to drive to play for the biggest possible team out there. It is very difficult for Stuttgart to [fight] against that.\"\nWhat is all the fuss about? Well, there are not many forwards who stand at 6'6\" tall and have the sort of ability that Woltemade possesses. The good-feet-for-a-big-man cliché might have been invented for him. Cacau, the legendary Stuttgart striker, sums it up.\n\"He is an amazing player,\" Cacau tells Sky Sports . \"He can score goals but he can also give assists. And he is a perfect player for Stuttgart, the perfect number nine. He plays very unconventionally because he is tall but he is also technical. Very, very good.\"\nRather oddly given his vast frame, Woltemade completed 31 dribbles in the Bundesliga last season. He is much more than a mere target man even if he obviously has the potential to fulfil that function. He can also roam wide, drop deep, bring others into play.\n\"Everybody can see also his dribbling and his technique,\" says Karazor. A modern twist on the big striker, then. And yet, it is this sense that he is a throwback to forwards of yesteryear that helps to explain his allure in Germany, a country still craving such players.\n\"You see the history of the German strikers, they are always tough, big guys, scoring a lot of goals,\" says Pizarro. \"And in the last years, you did not see that much. So I think it is going to be something special to get a player like that again in the Germany team.\"\nKlinsmann agrees. \"These number nines, on a global level, they are very, very rare. Very few countries have them. We love number nines in Germany so having this kid Woltemade coming up is a big hope because it is still a very important position to fill.\"\n\nThere remains a lot for him to learn. He only signed for Stuttgart last summer - and that on the back of a season in which he scored twice in 30 Bundesliga appearances for Werder Bremen. Pizarro was once a team-mate of his there despite being twice his age.\n\"I know him really well. I played with him when he was 17. When I was there, I was the experienced guy. He didn't talk much to me. I tried to talk to him but he was really quiet, but a nice guy. And I could see how he improved. I think that he is something special.\nPizarro adds: \"He has to learn still, because he is really big, but sometimes he does not use his body like he could do, or score many goals with the head. But as I said, he still needs a little bit of time to improve in some things, but I think he is a great player.\"\nThere is a feeling that, for now, that improvement is most likely to happen at Stuttgart where he would remain an important player, starting regularly in both the Bundesliga and in Europe. It is there, at the Swabian club, that he lifted the German Cup in May.\nAt Bayern, there is the prospect of him fitting into the team with Kane, particularly following the injury to Jamal Musiala and the exit of Thomas Muller. \"It could be an option,\" says Pizarro. \"You can see that he can play all around the front half in the pitch.\"\nBut the long-term ambition would be for him to assume Kane's mantle as Bayern's main striker. The question everyone is asking in Germany is when that journey should begin. \"Stuttgart is still a place where he can learn more,\" adds Pizarro. But for how long?\n\"It is a big challenge for him and for Stuttgart because it is a new situation for the player and the club and to manage everything is not easy,\" says Cacau. \"I hope that he can play one more year. And then he can leave for Bayern or maybe a Premier League club.\"\nUntil then, all eyes are on Nick Woltemade's every move.",

        "title": "Conor Hourihane interview: Barnsley boss on how coaching while playing led him to a head coach role at 34",
        "content": "A matter of weeks after captaining Derby to promotion from Sky Bet League One in May 2024, Conor Hourihane was released upon the expiry of his contract.\nAt 33, and having played 85 of a possible 92 league matches during his stay at Pride Park, signing the former Republic of Ireland international was an attractive proposition.\nBut, on a personal level, he found himself at a crossroads - did he continue playing? Or was it time to start exploring the next chapter?\nIn the end, he was able to combine the two options with a player-coach role at Barnsley, for whom he had made over 130 appearances between 2014 and 2017.\nHourihane only played two games, then retired on December 20 last year to become assistant head coach to Darrell Clarke.\nHis mind had already been made up long before.\n\"I didn't want to let go of playing, but the coaching was my drive and my fire,\" he tells Sky Sports .\n\"I came into pre-season and there wasn't really too much hunger to get fit and get firing, and there was more focus and determination around the coaching, so I probably knew from that moment that I wasn't really looking forward to coming in and training and doing the hard runs of pre-season.\n\"I kind of checked out a little bit and my full focus was around the coaching side of it. I knew where I was at pretty early in pre-season.\n\"To be able to call an end to my career on my own terms, in my own way, I was very satisfied by it, let's just say. I wasn't pushed in one direction, it wasn't an injury, it wasn't taken out of my hands. I just thought it was the right time because of what was on the horizon.\n\"I did wonder if I was letting go too early. Was I going to have enough focus with the coaching? Ever since my role started to broaden, there was no time to miss playing - and that's been the case ever since.\"\nClarke was sacked in March, with Hourihane taking charge on an interim basis, before he was handed a two-year contract just over a month later.\nNow, you are probably wondering how he was able to make the transition from active player to permanent head coach - the fourth youngest in the EFL at present - in such a short period of time. And it is a valid point.\nPlanning for life after football has become more prevalent in recent years and Hourihane, who is now studying for his Pro Licence with the FAI, started his journey towards that during a spell at Swansea in 2020/21.\n\"Steve Cooper was my manager there and I thought he was fantastic. How he looked after players, how he was on the training ground and his overall demeanour around coaching intrigued me a lot,\" he says.\n\"He's someone I'm very fond of. I really like his work, really like him as a man and we've met up on quite a few occasions over the last couple of years to pick each other's brains. He's a good friend and I'm very fortunate to have someone like him, someone I can lean on whenever I need to.\n\"There was an opportunity to do coaching badges over Zoom, so I jumped at the opportunity for that and it snowballed into more.\n\"I went to Stourbridge on Thursday nights when life opened back up because they were part-time and I knew the assistant manager there at the time. I live in Birmingham, so it was only about 40 minutes away. Then I coached Aston Villa U16s, then Barnsley U16s.\n\"Non-league really, really interesting. The night before I might text the assistant manager and ask what I had in terms of numbers? What part of the session did he want me to take? Did he want me to take any individuals after training?\n\"Then I'd turn up and, because they're part-time, two or three can't get out of work and one's running late because of traffic because it's peak traffic time. You're learning straightaway how to adapt your session, how to evolve your numbers.\n\"I might have four balls in my session when I probably need 10, but I have to make it work through a certain way of thinking outside the box.\n\"When you go to the academy, you know you're going to have set numbers, set coaches, and everything's going to run relatively smoothly. You get a different satisfaction from that.\"\nThis was all happening while Hourihane was still playing at Derby, who were supportive of their captain's endeavours. In truth, he never gave them any cause for concern.\n\"I pride myself on being a very, very good professional and I knew, every single day when I came in, I had to train properly and do everything right,\" he says.\n\"I just made time. Sometimes I'd come in at seven in the morning, rather than half eight, and sat down with one of the analysts because I need to look at some training sessions or I needed to do an assignment for my A Licence.\n\"When training was over, then it was my time maybe to switch my focus away from my playing onto coaching, like someone might do if they've got a pastime of playing golf or music or whatever it might be.\n\"It was a relentless cycle of how quickly can I improve? How much can I do on the grass to get better? It just became a big road and determination to be as good as I can, as early as I can.\n\"I was very, very fortunate to have a very supportive home as well that let me go off and do whatever I needed to do to end up right here in this position.\"\nThe 34-year-old has only been in the job, on a permanent basis, for four months, but he has found his biggest learning curve to date to be one he gave little thought to as a player.\n\"There haven't been too many curveballs yet, but if I had to pinpoint one thing, it would probably be the fact I do so much work to be as prepared as possible to get the lads in a really good place and then, ultimately, it doesn't guarantee you a win and it doesn't guarantee you a result,\" Hourihane explains.\n\"Early on, I found it quite difficult to accept that. I got better at that a little bit as the role moved forward into the end of the season, understanding you can give yourself a real good chance, but does it coincide with your guarantee to win? Obviously not or else everyone would do it the same way.\"\nYou can be sure he has not had that feeling yet this season.\nBarnsley sit third in League One after four league games, having won three and drawn one, with their most recent result a 1-0 victory away at Peterborough.\n\nThey are also through to the second round of the Carabao Cup after a penalty shootout win over Fleetwood.\nAt present, Sky Bet have them priced as 20/1 outsiders for the title, but 11/2 to win promotion, either by winning the title, finishing as runners-up or winning the play-offs.\nThat type of talk is premature, of course. Hourihane's focus for now is to justify his appointment.\n\"I'm very fond of the football club. I'm very fond of the opportunity they've given me and I want to repay them with doing this in my way and in the way that brings winning games of football,\" he adds.\n\"Right now, the philosophy is to be aggressive and high-pressing and then, when we win the ball back as quickly as possible, we control the game with the ball and in a certain structure around that that everyone has clarity on as well.\n\"Hopefully now we get that little bit of luck on match days and we start getting results to back up the work that we're doing.\"",

        "title": "Eberechi Eze Q&A: How Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur to Crystal Palace winger and what he can bring to Emirates",
        "content": "With Eberechi Eze heading for boyhood club Arsenal after the Gunners stole a march on north London rivals Spurs - who looked certain to sign him - what's the full story in yet another dramatic saga in one of the most memorable transfer windows ever?\nAt the start of Wednesday morning, Tottenham believed they had a deal agreed for the 27-year-old to join them for £67.5m, including add-ons.\nBut then in stepped Arsenal - who had previously had an interest in the England winger - to gazump them at the final hurdle.\nIt leaves Gunners fans delighted, their left-wing problems seemingly sorted and Spurs supporters, naturally, in a state of shock at losing out on a major summer signing to their closest rivals.\nHow has it all played out so far, and what's next for Arsenal, Spurs and Eze?\n\nSky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:\nI have some sympathy for Spurs. This is not Football Manager, this is real life. I don't want to kick Spurs when they're down - I'm trying to see it from the perspective of their hierarchy.\nI think they did everything they could to try to sell the club to Eze. A lot of Spurs fans are asking why they didn't trigger his release clause before Friday, but maybe they tried to do that and the player could've dragged his feet. Maybe he was keeping his options open.\n\nSpurs fans are very angry and criticising Daniel Levy and the owners, but I think we should keep things in perspective; these kinds of things happen all the time in the window.\nUltimately, everyone knows Eze is an Arsenal fan, as are his whole family. He played for them until he was 13 when he was released.\nIs this move motivated by the fact that Kai Havertz picked up this knee injury?\nOr have they been really smart and avoided getting involved in a bidding war? They knew he would choose Arsenal if he had a choice - and waited for Spurs to agree a deal before they turned up at the 11th hour and matched it. I think it's a bit of both.\nToday's a great day to be an Arsenal supporter. They have pulled off a real coup here. At the last minute, they matched Spurs' offer, and it's important to remember Eze himself is an Arsenal supporter.\n\nHis wish was very important in this - Arsenal matched Spurs' bid of £60m including £7.5m in add-ons. Remember, he had a release clause which expired last week which was worth up to £68m.\nArsenal have been interested in signing him all summer and their fans were crying out for them to make a move for him.\nWhen you looked at how much business they had already done this summer you could suggest they had to sell before they brought in another player.\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's previous release clause, of £68.5m - only £1m more than Arsenal are set to pay - expired last Friday.\nSpeaking after Sunday's 0-0 draw at Chelsea, which Eze started, Glasner said: \"I'm quite calm, but I also know we have two weeks to go, and I know Ebs' clause is gone, so it's the club's decision, and we will see what happens.\"\nTottenham could have guaranteed they would have their offer accepted earlier in the window by hitting that target, but only agreed a fee for Eze after it had already expired.\nSo why didn't they try to trigger it? \"It might've needed paying in one lump sum, said Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol. \"They might've waited until it expired to get a better deal.\"\nSky Sports News' Michael Bridge:\nTottenham Hotspur moved on from Eberechi Eze once it became clear he wanted to join Arsenal and they are now focusing on other targets.\nSpurs want to sign a No 10, a winger and a centre back ahead of the deadline.\nSeveral recent reports have linked Spurs with Tyler Dibling, but this is long-standing interest. There is interest in Monaco's Maghnes Akliouche.\nIt could be a very busy final few weeks at Spurs and clubs are aware they are prepared to pay £60m on the desired player after missing out on Morgan Gibbs-White and Eze for similar fees.\nSpurs feel they couldn't have done any more on both failed deals.\nSky Sports' Ron Walker:\nLast season, Arsenal's biggest difficulty was breaking down teams with a low block. They won only seven of 17 games where they had at least 60 per cent of the ball - picking up almost 0.4 points per game fewer than when they didn't.\nIn among his array of attacking talents, Eze has built a reputation as a defence breaker. Not only a technical marvel and excellent in one-on-one duels, he was one of the Premier League's best in delivering passes which broke opposition backlines last season. Only four players completed more take-ons across the Premier League in 2024/25.\nHe fits the bill for the defensive work rate Mikel Arteta demands, too. Eze won the ball back in the middle and defensive third more than almost any other attacking player in the Premier League last season.\nSky Sports' Paul Merson:\nEze is a brilliant signing for Arsenal. It's a game-changer and a perfect fit. If Arsenal had let Spurs get him, I'd have had to question what the club was doing because he's a quality player.\nArsenal struggle when teams come to the Emirates and put everyone behind the ball. Teams want to limit the space Arsenal have to play in and they have struggled to break teams down with those tactics.\nWe've seen it over the last few years where they have struggled to break teams down when it gets right to the business end of a game and the business end of a season.\nFor me, that's where Eze comes in at Arsenal. He's got the X-factor and in tight games, he has the ability to break a low block down.\nAway from home, maybe he's not the answer. Against the likes of Liverpool and Man City, they may come under the cosh for a bit, and they may have to play slightly differently.\nBut that's why you have a big squad. At home, against the lesser teams, where they have 70 to 80 per cent of the ball, let Eze go and do what he wants because he will make something happen.\nI think Arsenal win the league with Eze.\nThey had a chance without him because it's a real heads or tails season with Liverpool, and Man City played well on the opening weekend, but Eze helps get them over the line.\nSky Sports' Ron Walker:\nIf this late move for Eze is motivated by Havertz's injury, it stands to reason it will be someone else adding to their striking ranks because, bar a brief cameo as a false nine for England against Senegal earlier this summer, it's not a position where Eze has often featured.\nIt may instead mean a role change for Gabriel Martinelli, however. In fairness, the Brazilian has barely played through the middle in six years at the Emirates either, but it has long been seen as his eventual position by many Arsenal fans.\nHe was utilised as a No 9 against Liverpool late last season, more through necessity than design, but he showed a glimpse of what he can offer to supplement Viktor Gyokeres, Gabriel Jesus and Havertz as an option in spearheading Arsenal's attack.\nAfter his goalscoring exploits at Anfield, Gary Neville told Sky Sports : \"I actually think in the last half of this game Martinelli showed he actually could be a really dangerous centre-forward with his runs in behind.\"",

        "content": "Nicolas Jackson will not be part of Chelsea's matchday squad for the trip to West Ham on Friday, amid interest from Aston Villa.\nBlues boss Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker's absence in his press conference on Thursday morning.\n\"He [Jackson] is available, but he's not going to be part of the squad,\" Maresca said.\n\"We have two strikers, two players in that position and also we know something can happen before the transfer window closes.\n\"No idea [if a move away is close]. I prefer to be focused on training sessions and preparing for the game. I don't know.\"\nVilla are understood to have explored the conditions of a deal for the 24-year-old, who played under head coach Unai Emery at Villarreal.\nJackson told Chelsea earlier this month that he wants to consider his options during the transfer window. Chelsea signed strikers Joao Pedro and Liam Delap this summer.\nJackson was absent from Chelsea's squad for friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan ahead of the Premier League season.\nThe striker served the final game of a suspension in Chelsea's first fixture of the season against Crystal Palace.\nJackson scored 13 goals in 37 appearances across all competitions last season, having netted 17 in 44 during his first year at the club.\nChelsea have sold a host of players this summer, with another nine likely to leave, while Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons top targets to bolster their attacking line.\nSky Sports' Paul Merson on The Premier League Show:\n\"I like Jackson, I've seen a lot of him. He's a bit messy and his touch will be poor - but I'd love to play with him. The position I played in, I'd love to have played with him because he opens games up. If I were Aston Villa or Newcastle, I'd buy him all day long. He goes the other way, and on a big pitch like Newcastle's, you could get Bruno Guimaraes or Sandro Tonali more on the ball.\n\"If you asked a lot of defenders, I reckon after the game - even though he is messy and needs more coaching - I don't think there would be too many centre-halves who would say: that was easy. He gives you a hard time, he's willing to run.\n\"I'm pretty shocked with Chelsea. He made Cole Palmer and Palmer made Jackson. They worked as a pair and really stretched the game and it got Palmer on the ball and let him do his stuff.\n\"Now I don't see that. Joao Pedro wants to come short and compresses Palmer's game. I know we're one game in, but Palmer is going further and further back to get the ball. You don't want him there, you want him around the box as he can weave his magic as he is the X factor.\n\"I don't think this is a great move for Chelsea. I think it's a mistake. Jackson could come back to haunt them if he went to Newcastle or Villa, by scoring a few goals.\"\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\nJackson's future will be resolved when it becomes clear whether Alexander Isak is staying at or leaving Newcastle United.\nThere are up to six clubs interested in signing Jackson and Chelsea are expecting significant bids when there is more clarity about Isak's future.\nAston Villa are one of the interested clubs, but it remains to be seen whether they would be able to afford the asking price.\nJackson's value will be determined by the market price paid for strikers by Premier League clubs this summer.\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\nChelsea are close to agreeing a deal to sell Renato Veiga to Villarreal in a deal expected to be worth £26m (€30m).\nThe defender joined Chelsea last summer from Basel for £12m on a contract until June 2031.\nHe scored two goals in 18 appearances before spending the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, where he played 15 times.\nVeiga was also called up to the Portugal squad after signing for Chelsea and has earned five caps.\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\nFulham are considering making a move to sign Raheem Sterling from Chelsea, but a deal appears unlikely at the moment.\nSterling is expected to leave Chelsea this summer after spending last season on loan at Arsenal.\nHe has been training away from the first-team squad and did not travel to the United States for the Club World Cup.\nChelsea signed him from Manchester City three years ago in a £47.5m deal and he has two years left on his contract.\nSterling has not played for Chelsea since he scored against Bournemouth in the final game of the 2023/24 season.\nIn\nJamie Gittens - Dortmund, £51.5m\nJoao Pedro - Brighton, £60m\nLiam Delap - Ipswich, £30m\nJorrel Hato - Ajax, £38.5m\nEstevao Willian - Palmeiras, £29m\nDario Essugo - Sporting, £18.5m\nMamadou Sarr - RC Strasbourg, £12m\nKendry Paez - Independiente del Valle, £17.3m\nOut\nKendry Paez - Strasbourg, loan\nDjordje Petrovic - Bournemouth, £25m\nBashir Humphrey - Burnley, undisclosed\nDylan Williams - Burton, undisclosed\nMarcus Bettinelli - Man City, undisclosed\nKepa Arrizabalga - Arsenal, £5m\nTeddy Sharman-Lowe - Bolton, loan\nMathis Amougou - Strasbourg, undisclosed\nZak Sturge - Millwall, undisclosed\nNoni Madueke - Arsenal, £52m\nCaleb Wiley - Watford, loan\nMike Penders - RC Strasbourg, loan\nJoao Felix - Al Nassr, £43.7m\nIshe Samuels-Smith - Strasbourg, £6.9m\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall - Everton, £29m\nMamadou Sarr - Strasbourg, loan\nLeo Castledine - Huddersfield, loan\nLesley Ugochukwu - Burnley, undisclosed\nMarc Guiu - Sunderland, loan\nArmando Broja - Burnley, £20m\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

Eze's Arsenal medical could take place as soon as Friday.\nMerson insists Eze moving to Arsenal is a \"game-changer\" with the former Gunner suggesting the England international could be a key figure in breaking down stubborn defences, particularly at Emirates Stadium.\n\"Eze is a brilliant signing for Arsenal,\" Merson said. \"It's a game-changer and a perfect fit.\n\"If Arsenal had let Spurs get him, I'd have had to question what the club was doing because he's a quality player.\n\"Arsenal struggle when teams come to the Emirates and put everyone behind the ball.

The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself.\nHe finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first ever major honour.\nLast season wasn't all plain sailing, though. \"I think Ebere has had a strange season,\" said Palace boss Glasner at the end of March. \"He hasn't had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He's also struggled with strange injuries.\"\nThose comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in a FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in.\nIt is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta.\nAfter being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second chance in north London - and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Mikel Arteta.\nWatch Arsenal vs Leeds on Saturday night Football on Sky Sports; kick-off 5.30pm\n\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

So now we have owners and a leadership team that understand where the club's been and where it's at and where it needs to go to, but they also understand that's not going to come without a bit of pain.\"\nMartin insists he is \"enjoying\" his time at Ibrox and wants to be \"judged in May\", adding \"by then we'll be in a really good place\". However, when you look at the recent managerial tenures at Ibrox - he knows to last until May, things need to improve, both in performances and results.\nIn short, and on the whole, they have been disappointing.\nRangers got things underway by progressing past Panathinaikos in their opening Champions League qualifier - but they rode their luck at times.\nThat luck continued into their opening league game of the season, but not how you may expect. Martin admitted his team \"were lucky to get a point\" at Fir Park, before slamming the attitude and mentality of his players as they drew 1-1.\n\nThe jeers of Fir Park did turn into cheers at Ibrox days later as Martin got the reaction he wanted during a brilliant 3-0 win over Viktoria Plzen in their next European encounter. Many fans expected their team to kick on and progress. They are still waiting.\nIt took an injury-time James Tavernier penalty to snatch a draw at home to Dundee, a result again met with boos from the crowd. They lost in the Czech Republic but progressed past Plzen thanks to that first-leg win and they were unconvincing again as they struggled past third-tier Alloa Athletic at Ibrox in the League Cup.\n\nOf their three wins to that point, two came in Europe at home - so fans had hope they could get a result against Club Brugge in their Champions League play-off first-leg.\nThat hope was extinguished after just seven minutes when Rangers were 2-0 down, and it looked like things could get ugly when it was 3-0 with 20 minutes on the clock. Rangers did rally and pulled one goal back in the second half, but it was that first-half performance that has left fans with concerns heading into a huge couple of weeks.\nA lot was made of Martin's style and philosophy before he took the job at Ibrox. Questions were raised if it would work against a low block that Rangers often face domestically. Fans were also worried he would not adapt during games if plan A didn't work.\nWell, the first eight games have not done much to quell those concerns.\n\nThere are new partnerships across the backline that need time to gel. However, at times they have been far too open and required big saves from goalkeeper Jack Butland.\nIn half of those games, the opposition have managed to take more shots at the Rangers goal than Martin's side had in the match. Panathinaikos managed 34 across both legs, Motherwell had 14 in the league opener and Viktoria Plzen managed 14 at Ibrox, plus 27 in the away tie. It is a worrying trend.\nAlthough there were some unnerving moments, the performance against Viktoria Plzen at Ibrox was more of what Martin and the fans have wanted. Rangers were aggressive, showed high levels of intensity with the ball, they attacked their opponents, there were plenty of runs in behind and there were goals.\nConsistency is the next requirement. Aside from an expected win over third-tier Alloa in the cup, Rangers are yet to taste victory since that performance. There's no doubt going forward - with new signings Djedi Gassama and Oliver Antman on the wing - that Rangers fans could be entertained. However, they need a complete display at both ends of the park.\nIt has been an eventful four weeks or so as Martin's side were thrown into the deep end across three competitions. However, the month will be even more crucial.\nThree huge league games await, featuring a game against St Mirren that Rangers initially wanted called off to better prepare for Europe. That went out the window when they fell behind their rivals after just two games. Then it's a huge first Old Firm clash of the season at Ibrox and after the international break, Hearts visit Ibrox as they bid to split the Old Firm this season.\nAlongside that, there's the second leg of that Club Brugge tie which will determine the European competition Rangers feature in. If they can turn it around, the riches of the Champions League await. If not, the familiar path of the Europa League lie ahead.\nAt the end of the upcoming stretch of games is their League Cup quarter-final against Hibernian. Silverware is a must at Rangers, so the importance of that won't be lost on the fans and squad.\nSky Sports News' Gordon Duncan:\n\"The first half against Club Brugge was an absolute disaster. Russell Martin speaks about knowing there will be a bit of pain. For Rangers fans, there is just too much pain in the early stages. It is one thing losing but the manner of it and the capitulation early on, fans leaving midway through the first half, booing at half-time and full-time. The second half got better, and on paper, they've kept the tie alive but it feels like the start to the game is what Rangers fans will cling onto. It is not in isolation either, dropping points to Motherwell and Dundee in the Scottish Premiership, even some of the games in Europe and the League Cup win - Rangers have not been at their fluent best. This felt like an accumulation for Rangers fans and the frustration was clear for all to see and hear.\n\n\"Russell Martin will look at the fixtures ahead and see it as an opportunity to turn things around but it is a very tricky fixture list. The Club Brugge tie is still to come, but before that going away to St Mirren on Sunday. Rangers were going to postpone that game to give themselves the best chance of navigating the European ties but then things became tricky in the league, they fell behind the decision to postpone that game and it was put on the back burner. It is a notoriously difficult place to go.\n\"After those games, it is the date all fans have circled, August 31 - Celtic at Ibrox. We all know that is about more than just the three points.\n\"The next few weeks could be crucial for Rangers. If you are a glass-half-full optimist like Russell Martin, you see it as a chance to show what you are capable of. If you are a glass-half-empty type, you might see Rangers' season being all but over by that point. It is a vital period coming up.\"\n\nFollowing the defeat to Club Brugge, former Rangers striker Kris Boyd on Sky Sports:\n\"Rangers have got a huge league game on Sunday in Paisley [against St Mirren].\n\"There are so-called leaders within that Rangers team to lead by example but they never done that in the first-half against Club Brugge. It was embarrassing - to be 2-0 down after seven minutes and 3-0 down after 20 minutes - there is nothing to be positive about for Rangers after that game.\n\"The sad thing about it is, it is the same mistakes that seem to be happening time after time for Rangers. People not doing their jobs, not playing as a team collectively and looking after themselves. That would be a worry. For any team, it doesn't how good you are - you have to work as a team, be hard to beat. I don't think this Rangers team have got that. They are so open and easy to play through.\"\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports News, Rangers podcaster and author Martyn Ramsay said:\n\"He had to hit the ground running for thousands of fans who pretty much made up their mind immediately. If he is to turn this around, it would be one of the most remarkable stories in the club's history.\n\"If we lose the Old Firm game and there is a disaster in the League Cup, it will feel that way [that the season is over].\n\"The Club Brugge game felt like the end of days that we've experienced over the past few years, with fans reaching the end of their patience, but on August 19. To detached readers, that will be ridiculous but that is just life here.\n\n\"If you are going to try rip up a culture that is weak, and it really has not been good enough for some time, and move to a style of football that the new owners want - that is not going to be done in jig time.\n\"Rangers' recruitment looks okay in some of the most supplementary areas of the pitch, especially out wide. However, we still lack a core spine of players from goalkeeper to number nine that are reliable, consistent, confident, inspire the rest of the dressing room and make dressing rooms around the country realise this is a game changer. I don't care who the manager is - without that spine throughout the team, this can't be changed.\n\"I think the fans have made their minds up [over Russell Martin]. They will change if results change, that is the nature of football fandom. However, the conversations I am in on a daily basis - I have been used to that after a manager has had a year and it has not worked out and you get to the end of that cycle, not after a few weeks.\n\"What has changed and is going to be very interesting… the previous owners were wealthy fan investors and would always respond to fan pressure. I wonder if [the new owners] with that sense of detachment if they will say no, we know the situation here, we know how long this will take and we are going to hang fire.\"",

        "title": "Celtic: What next for Brendan Rodgers and the board as fan frustrations increase? | 'We lack ambition'",
        "content": "\"It's normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung.\"\nChants of sack the board echoed around Celtic Park after their Champions League play-off draw with Kairat Almaty , with Brendan Rodgers suggesting he could be the one made to leave.\nThere is unrest from the fans due to a lack of summer transfer business, with Rodgers pointing out the failure to strengthen before their first leg was \"not my decision\" and conceded he has to \"accept where it's at\".\n\nBut given Celtic have won their first two Premiership games, have progressed in the League Cup and are just 90 minutes from European football's elite club competition, are things really as bad as the supporters believe?\nCeltic have made seven summer signings, with three being free transfers, and they are yet to replace some notable departures.\nKieran Tierney returned to Parkhead while goalkeeper Ross Doohan is also back at the Hoops on a three-year deal after leaving Aberdeen.\nCeltic have also signed winger Benjamin Nygren from FC Nordsjaelland in a deal worth around £2m, defender Hayato Inamura has joined from Albirex Niigata and Shin Yamada has moved from J-League side Kawasaki Frontale .\nThe club also secured the signing of teenage forward Callum Osmand on a free from Fulham with Jahmai Simpson-Pusey joining on a season-long loan from Manchester City.\nWinger Nicolas Kuhn left for Como earlier this month, Kyogo Furuhashi's successor is yet to be found after his January departure and Jota is expected to miss a large spell of this campaign through injury.\nAnd could a right-back now be on the wanted list after Alistair Johnston was stretchered off during Wednesday night's game with a hamstring injury?\nRodgers' post-match comments once again highlighted the strained relationship he has with the board. He has entered the final year of his deal and, while he is \"200 per cent\" ready to see out this season, he has already said he is 'not the right guy' to just maintain something .\n\"You know these games are tough games and you want to have your best players in and have players in as quick as you can to tackle these sorts of situations,\" he said after the disappointing draw.\n\"But listen, it is what it is and I just have to accept where it's at and we'll now get ready for Saturday and then the long haul on Sunday.\n\"We need to improve the squad. There was clarity around that for a long time.\n\"So we see that. I think supporters see that. We certainly do in football. We need to improve.\n\"This is a performance club. This is a club that has to perform. And that starts on the field. You do that with getting the very best players you possibly can to allow you to perform.\"\n\nAsked about the fans' reaction, the Northern Irishman said: \"I do know that, over many years, 'sack the board' normally means 'sack the manager'.\n\"It's normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung.\n\"I can only really look at the players we have here, and the performance.\n\"We've known for a long time what we've needed as a squad, so I don't want to go into that.\"\n\nRodgers wants to be the best, he makes no secret of that. Challenging in the Champions League is his next target with Celtic.\nThe Scottish champions reached the knockout phase of the tournament last season for the first time in 12 years after losing just twice in eight games in the league format, and were then seconds away from extra-time against Bayern Munich.\nAfter that impressive showing in the Allianz Arena, the 52-year-old outlined his belief that they could reach the next stage of the competition . Fast-forward six months and they have so far failed to strengthen for that possibility.\nCeltic podcaster Paul John Dykes told Sky Sports News the supporters are right to be concerned.\n\"Brendan Rodgers is the only spokesperson at Celtic at the moment, I think he's becoming frustrated answering the same questions every day when it comes to recruitment.\n\"Why can't we get the deals over the line? This is a big issue.\n\"As fans, I think we're balanced. I think they look at it and say, well, some players will be hedging their bets to see if Celtic get into the Champions League proper and I totally understand that, but Celtic need to be decisive in the transfer market.\n\"I think that we lack ambition. I don't think that the boardroom has the same ambition as Brendan Rodgers and certainly the same ambition as a lot of the fans.\n\"It was clear for everyone to see that we were at that cusp, we were seconds away from taking Bayern Munich into extra time that night.\n\"We could all see as fans where we had to strengthen and we've still not strengthened seven months later and that's hugely frustrating.\"\nThere is no doubt the silence from the Celtic board has been deafening.\nChief executive Michael Nicholson and chairman Peter Lawwell are at almost every game, but neither have addressed any of the issues raised by the manager or the fans.\nThere is also majority shareholder Dermot Desmond. Rodgers was his appointment but even he must realise he is losing faith with the desire to take the club to the next level.\nPeterborough owner Darragh MacAnthony believes there is a simple way to ease the tension. Communication.\n\"I always say, just be transparent,\" he told Sky Sports News .\n\"If you've got an issue as a club or you don't want to spend £100m you've got sitting there, just tell them why.\n\"Just say to the fans, look, we need a bit of patience. We can't quite get deals done. People maybe have turned us down. We can't hit those wage metrics because it would then affect the rest of the squad.\n\"Just come out and talk to the fans.\"",

        "title": "Jeremie Frimpong injury: Liverpool defender ruled out until after the international break, missing Newcastle and Arsenal games",
        "content": "Liverpool defender Jeremie Frimpong has been ruled out until after the September international break.\nThe Dutch right-back - who limped off during the Premier League opener against Bournemouth - will miss Liverpool's crucial games against Newcastle on Monday, and Arsenal on the following Sunday. Both games are live on Sky Sports .\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"The medical team was completely right about Jeremie, to tell me I had to take him off because he's out until the end of the international break.\n\"I think I got criticised a bit by taking him off. [The medical staff] felt he had an issue in his hamstring. Good call to take him off otherwise he might have been out for longer. We expect to have him back after the international break.\"\n\nConor Bradley returned to training with the first team on Thursday while Joe Gomez is another right-back option in the squad - but Slot said he has not played a lot of minutes, raising doubts about his ability to start.\n\"Conor played for a few minutes with us today, for the first time,\" said Slot, who revealed Wataru Endo and Dominik Szoboszlai could also fit in at right-back. Curtis Jones has also slotted in at right-back before for Liverpool and England.\n\"These things happen in a season. We have only at the moment two injuries - unfortunately it's two for the same position,\" added Slot.\n\"The good thing is some others can play in that position as well. Wataru played in that position for a few minutes, Dominik Szoboszlai already played in that position. There are other options we can explore.\n\"Joe Gomez is definitely one of them. But for him to already play 20 minutes, that was already quite a lot. I wouldn't say he had a setback but he wasn't able to train three days in a row completely with the team. It's completely normal if you've been out for so long and all of a sudden the manager needs you for 20 minutes.\n\"He's training with the team so let's see where he is on Monday, if he can be involved in the team or if he can even start. But there are other options as well.\n\"You cannot prepare for two injuries in one position. It would be stupid for us to have three full-backs or five left-backs - although we have three left-backs!\"\nSky Sports' Paul Merson on The Premier League Show:\n\"You worry for those two games coming up. The way they play, they let [Mohamed] Salah stay up top and he doesn't have to be tracking back.\n\"And now with Harvey Barnes probably playing out on that wing for Newcastle, then either Eberechi Eze or Gabriel Martinelli playing there the week after, they will have to get through those next two games.\n\"That gives the other two teams a chance.\n\"I was at the Community Shield the week before and I was worried about Liverpool defensively. Frimpong likes bombing forward and Salah is staying up the pitch. There's always going to be space down their right and the opposition's left. I worry for Liverpool down there.\n\"If Frimpong's injured and Bradley is fit - it's probably the right move for them in the next two games who have ammunition down that side of the pitch.\n\"Bradley isn't fit yet, Gomez has had a few injuries so it's only right you look after him. So it will be interesting. That's where you can hurt Liverpool, anywhere else I'm not too sure.\"\nLiverpool received some criticism for their defending in the season opener against Bournemouth, with Jamie Carragher calling it \"absolutely shocking\".\nHowever, the Reds will be boosted by the return of midfielder Ryan Gravenberch , who was suspended last Friday following a red card on the final day of last season.\n\"If he's the same player as he was last season that could help us a lot,\" said Slot of Gravenberch.\n\"If you look at the second goal we conceded [against Bournemouth] they could go from one side to the other side without being attacked. If you look back at last season, every single time Ryan played, he would have been in that position.\n\n\"For him not being there and us playing with very good players but very attacking-minded players, that for example hurt us in that goal. And that wasn't the first time where we lacked a player in that position in a counter-attack for the other team.\"\nAnalysis by Sky Sports' Richard Morgan:\nLiverpool head coach Arne Slot will have various options to pick from to replace the injured Jeremie Frimpong at right-back after the Netherlands international suffered a hamstring injury in the champions' opening-night win over Bournemouth, although none of them are ideal.\nFrimpong will be out until after the international break, meaning Slot now needs cover for the upcoming Premier League games at Newcastle United on Monday Night Football , followed by the huge clash with title rivals Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday August 31.\nConor Bradley would be the natural choice, but the right-back has only just returned to training after his own hamstring issue saw him return early from the club's preseason tour of the Far East.\nThe experienced Joe Gomez , meanwhile, would be another option, but like Bradley, the versatile defender is also only just back from an Achilles injury that cut short his summer tour of Hong Kong and Japan. And while Gomez did come on for the final 18 minutes against Bournemouth, Slot indicated that Monday's trip to St James' Park may come too soon for him, at least to start the game.\nAnd that could see the Dutchman having to convert a midfield player into a right-back, with the likes of Wataru Endo - who initially replaced Frimpong on Friday Night Football , before Gomez took over in the role - Dominik Szoboszlai , or most likely Curtis Jones - who was used there against Everton and Fulham during a similar injury crisis last April, while Thomas Tuchel also played him there in his first game as England boss - all candidates.\nUnless, of course, Slot opts to try recent new centre-back signing Giovanni Leoni out in an unfamiliar right-back role, as he did with Jarell Quansah in last season's League Cup final loss to Newcastle at Wembley.\nBut whoever he goes for, trying to tame Newcastle's pacy left-sided forward Harvey Barnes under the St James' lights will be no easy task.\nAugust 25: Newcastle (A), Premier League, kick-off 8pm, live on Sky Sports\nAugust 31: Arsenal (H), Premier League, kick-off 4.30pm, live on Sky Sports\nSeptember 14: Burnley (A), Premier League, kick-off 2pm, live on Sky Sports\nSeptember 16-18: First Champions League game of the season\nSeptember 20: Everton (H), Premier League, kick-off 12.30pm\nSeptember 27: Crystal Palace (A), Premier League, kick-off 2pm",

        "content": "Oliver Glasner insists Marc Guehi has to stay at Crystal Palace for at least their Conference League play-off second leg and says the club should have replaced Eberechi Eze earlier in the window.\nLiverpool are interested in signing Guehi, who has entered the final year of his contract, while Eze is set to move to Arsenal after the clubs agreed a £67.5m deal on Wednesday.\nGlasner admitted that Palace knew there was a \"high chance\" that Eze would leave this summer and that \"we missed replacing him early. That's completely our fault and nobody else's fault.\"\nWith less than two weeks of the window to go, a blunt Glasner also added: \"We are very, very late. It's 10 days to go [until the transfer window closes] to find the right replacements. I think we could have done much better than we did. It's no criticism, it's just telling facts.\"\nGuehi started and captained Palace to a 1-0 victory in the first leg of their Conference League tie against Fredrikstad on Thursday night, but the registration deadline has since passed, meaning no new signings can feature in the second leg next week.\nGlasner joked he is considering filling in at centre-back if Guehi were to leave before the match on August 28, four days before the window closes on September 1, amid his concerns over the lack of depth in his squad.\n\"Today, we had 17 on-field players available. One from the academy, two players we already told that they should leave the club. So that means we're with 14 and having six games from the 10th of August until the 31st.\n\"This group, I know we can rely on them. I trust them completely. But it's really not the best way you should start into the season. With the results, third game, no defeat, that's all good. But I think we are below the edge.\n\"I just know if Marc leaves and is not available for Frederikstad, we will have big troubles. That's pretty clear. We can't register anyone. So from my side, he has to stay.\n\n\"We played with Jeff Lerma in the back today. He's a midfield player. We have no centre-back available at the moment. If Marc leaves, I will try my boots because I was a centre-back, and this could be a good option. I will think about it.\"\nBut in contrast, Parish said: \" If Marc wants to sign a contract, then he can stay!\n\"It is a difficult situation. If you are in Europe, the financial rules are a lot tighter than in the Premier League.\n\"Players leaving on a free is not ideal. We will have to look at it over the next 11 days.\"\nGlasner also hit out at Palace over not replacing Eze sooner.\n\"I can't do anything. I can't sign the players. I can't sign a player's contract. So we have to act. We need this. This is Crystal Palace's future,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to add not numbers. It's easy to add 10 numbers. We need the right players. The profile is defined for months. It's not surprising for everyone that Ebs left. Honestly, it's not surprising.\n\"Five days earlier, we couldn't have done anything if he leaves. We knew that the chance was very high that this would happen. Honestly, and I say it like it is, we missed replacing him early enough. That's completely our fault and nobody else's fault.\"\nOn Eze's departure, Parish added: \"We have to move past it. He has been fantastic for us and we are pleased he will go on to fulfill his ambitions.\n\"We have to find other players to support the team and Oliver Glasner. We will bring in players, it is about finding the right players.\n\"I don't think Oliver wants too many, I think it is the right number.

        "title": "Arsenal's goals from corners: How can Premier League rivals stop Mikel Arteta and Nicolas Jover's set-piece tactics?",
        "content": "Arsenal have won five corners this season, they have scored from three of them.\nScoring from their first set piece of the season to win the game at Manchester United was a flex of their muscles - but Jurrien Timber scoring from two corners in a 5-0 win over Leeds is simply ludicrous. \"Arsenal's corner and goals count is really special,\" said Gary Neville on Saturday.\nIt is a common sight. Since the 2023/24 campaign, the Gunners have scored 33 goals from corners. No other Premier League team has more than 20 in that time, while Arsenal also have 10 more corner goals than any other major team in Europe.\nArsenal have been regarded as set-piece experts for around 18 months now - but this early flurry of corner goals at the start of this Premier League season is a message to their rivals: put plenty of time and focus on trying to stop this, or they will hurt you.\nSo how can their Premier League rivals even start to think about stopping them?\n\n\nArsenal's corner routine begins like any other - with the taker, normally Rice or Bukayo Saka, putting their arm up in the air so the players in the middle know when to start their combinations.\nBut what those players in the middle are going to do is more unpredictable. Arsenal have had multiple routines but also multiple starting positions. Sometimes the Gunners players group together at the back post but at Old Trafford on Sunday, they all gathered on the edge of the box.\nThe reason why is to make short runs into the box and create momentum for when the ball arrives in the danger zone. But it also creates a bit of chaos, with opposition players being blocked off from trying to defend the ball.\n\"They've done it for a long period of time in terms of the timing - when they start moving, how they move, when they get to the dangerous area, whether it's the front or the back post,\" set-piece coach Marc Orti Esteban told Sky Sports .\nUntil last season, Orti Esteban was a set-piece analyst at Brentford before leaving to oversee New England Revolution's dead-ball department. Working under Keith Andrews, he was tasked with trying to work out how to stop Arsenal from set-pieces.\nAnd his best advice to try to stop that Arsenal chaos? Control it.\n\"It's all about breaking their timing and what they do - they are very good at that,\" Esteban said.\n\"If you can stop that with physicality, stopping their runs, making it hard for them to move like they want to do, then you have a better chance of defending that situation.\n\"It's about being smart and knowing that they can deliver to the front or the back post. So you have to be covered in those areas.\"\nTeams have tried that in the past, putting a big focus on trying to halt Gabriel's run towards the penalty box. The Brazilian defender - who has 17 goals from set-pieces in the last five years - can sometimes be seen hovering in the middle of the penalty area, before attacking the ball with a run from deep.\nThe only issue with using physicality is Premier League referees are clamping down on that this season. There will be stricter punishments for tugging players back in the penalty area. \"I would expect this time next year for there to have been a few more penalties given for holding offences than what we've seen this year,\" said Howard Webb before this season started.\nArsenal will have to focus on that too, as their 'blocking' of defenders will be scrutinised a lot more. So it shows the importance of being street-wise when the Gunners get corners.\nOne of those 'street-wise' moments that Arsenal and their opponents have to monitor is how the Gunners players affect the opposition goalkeeper - a factor Manchester United found out on Sunday.\nGoalkeeper Bayindir was deemed at fault for Calafiori's goal, but there was also some clever play involving William Saliba, with the Arsenal defender leaning into the United shot-stopper.\nLeeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri was also stuck by Saliba for Timber's first goal on Saturday. \"The goalkeeper can't come because of the bodies around him,\" said Neville on co-commentary duty.\n\nDespite the PGMOL looking to clamp down on holding in the box, VAR deem Saliba's interventions as normal football contact.\nWith Arsenal looking to take advantage of every marginal gain a corner brings, this was another rule they managed to bend in their favour - especially given how they like to attack the six-yard box during corners. And it is not the first time Arsenal have tried and benefited from that tactic.\nIn the 3-2 north London derby win at Spurs in 2024, Ben White was seen doing a similar trick on Guglielmo Vicario - giving the Italian goalkeeper a shove - a bounce off the shoulder - so he would be unable to claim the cross, allowing Kai Havertz to nod in a close-range header.\n\nIt has not always worked, especially involving White. The England international tried a similar tactic in a 1-0 win at Leicester in 2023 - holding onto goalkeeper Danny Ward's glove in the hope that VAR would not catch it. But when Leandro Trossard found the net, it was spotted.\n\nBending the rules? Yes - but it is something that is seen a lot in Arsenal's corner routines. So a strong goalkeeper is a must.\nLast season, some teams tried a new defensive corner tactic against Arsenal to help their defenders get to and clear the ball, including their goalkeeper.\nCrystal Palace, Brighton, Monaco and Spurs all left two or three players up on the halfway line, meaning Arsenal were forced to leave a few players back. That not only decreases the number of players in and around the penalty box but also creates space for goalkeepers to come and claim the ball.\n\n\"Usually they come with six running into the six-yard box, causing a lot of noise and trouble\" Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner said last season. \"They are blocking, pushing, and then it looks like every single ball comes to the spot where they expect it.\n\"The Man Utd game against Arsenal [where Arsenal scored twice from corners in a 2-0 win], United had eight players in the six-yard box to defend, and I think they could have conceded five.\n\"We wanted that the box is clearer. It was.\"\nThe only problem? Arsenal still managed to score from a corner against Palace through Havertz. That was because there were fewer defenders on hand to react to the German scoring after the ball came off the post. \"We defended the first ball but we didn't defend the second ball, the rebound,\" said Glasner.\n\"I think it was not an issue of having three players up, it was just that we have to be so sharp in every situation.\"\nAfter Palace tried that tactic, Spurs came to the Emirates and attempted something similar - but ended up conceding a goal from a corner themselves as Gabriel forced a Dominic Solanke own goal. It has not been seen again.\nSo no matter what teams end up coming up with to foil Arsenal, the Gunners keep on scoring. Leeds and their head coach Daniel Farke's side putting a focus on set-pieces themselves this summer, signing solely players who are 5ft 11in and above to be strong at set pieces.\nBut if they still cannot stop Arsenal from corners - who else can?",

Now the hard work begins, and I want to promise the fans that I will give everything to win more trophies and bring more success to City.\"\nCity director of football, Hugo Viana, added: \"His performances over the past five years have been outstanding and he is a big reason why we have been so successful.

There is always two sides to a story. We will see where we are in a week's time. I hope I can work with him again.\"\nHowe spoke fondly of Isak, adding there were no issues between the head coach and player personally, and he was sure the squad would also welcome the striker back into the fold.\n\"I haven't seen him this week. I saw him last week. When I see him, we speak as normal, there's no issues there between us... I'm sure we'll catch up at some stage and hopefully speak soon,\" he added.\n\n\"There's no doubt how the players will feel - they'll feel the same way I do. Alex is an outstanding player and he's a good person, a good character. He wants to succeed in his career.\n\"This has been a difficult situation for him and the players to see us without him. They've handled it really well. But if Alex decided to come back and play for us, the players would welcome him.\"\nHowe also confirmed that Isak will not be involved for a second successive Premier League game against Liverpool on Monday Night Football, adding he would like to see the Sweden international back in action for Newcastle.\n\"No, there's been no change [in Isak's situation],\" he said. \"He won't be part of the squad for this weekend's game.\n\n\"My preference for these things is that it doesn't happen publicly because everything is better dealt with behind closed doors.\n\"But needs must and the club has spoken, probably justifiably so in that moment. Of course [I hope he can be re-integrated]. He is contracted to us, he's our player.\n\"My wish is he would be playing on Monday night with us, but he won't be and that's regrettable, but I want to 100 per cent see him in a Newcastle shirt.\"",

It's normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung.\"\nAhead of Saturday's Scottish Premiership game against Livingston, he was asked if there was a chance the current situation would accelerate an exit before his contract expires next summer.\n\"Absolutely no chance. We've done that one before. It didn't go down well,\" he said.\n\"I said from the first day, and there's no hidden messages, and there's no this and that, I said I'd be here for three years. I'm here for three years.\"\nThe 52-year-old also stressed, despite perceptions about his relationship with the board, that everyone at the club is pulling in the same direction.\n\"People try and look to find that conflict between me and the board or me and whoever,\" he continued.\n\"It really isn't the case. You know, the board here at the football club of over many years managed the financial side of the game and run the club to an impeccable level.\n\"My job here as the football manager is to really drive and demand and for us to live in a cycle where we understand that we will lose some players. But that it doesn't have this massive impact that it seems to sometimes do and that we can just lose big players and then bring in other ones, rather than to wait.\n\"So, that cycle I want us to be in, but there's certainly no conflict.\n\"Everyone at this club, from the board to myself, we want the very, very best for Celtic.\n\"For me, longer term, I don't think so much as the manager. We had the chances over the summer, but I said, now the season starts, I only want to think of the football.\n\"I don't want to think of the contract, just think of the football and that will come away later on if it does.\"\n\nRodgers revealed defender Alistair Johnston will be out for \"about 12 weeks\" after injuring his hamstring in the first leg against Kairat Almaty.\nHe did suggest they would expore internally for his replacement.\n\"He'll probably be about 12 weeks, so he obviously had his scan yesterday, so it's disappointing for him because he's come back and started well, so that's where we're at,\" the manager added.\n\"When you lose any player, especially of that calibre, then of course it is a disappointment, but it'll provide an opportunity for someone to step in.\n\"We know we have Tony [Ralston], I've got young Colby Donovan, who as a young player here has really impressed me over the time I've been back here and in this last 12 months, he's made great strides.\n\"It's always an opportunity for someone, but of course for Ali, we just want to make sure that we're in a really good position in all competitions when he gets back.\n\"My first look is always inside and that's something that will gain more clarity over the next week or so.\"",

There must be someone out there who thinks it's good fun to put the rumours out there.\n\n\"There's been a lot of links and will continue to be. To be very general, I don't want any players who don't want to come to the club.\n\"If they don't want to come here and wear this fantastic badge, we don't want them here. That's very clear, and I imagine the fans feel exactly the same.\n\"That's a key message.\"\nDespite their disappointment so far this summer, bringing in only two new faces in Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus, Frank said he remained confident more arrivals would be forthcoming in the final 10 days of the transfer window.\nHe said: \"Of course, we want to do everything we can to be competitive. We have six very good front players who will be very competitive across all the competitions - and (Dejan) Kulusevski will come back this season, it's probably longer-term with (James) Maddison unfortunately.\n\n\"I'm confident though that we will sign another player before the end of the window. In general, any club wants to sign players as early as possible. If it was that easy, everyone would do it.\n\"I'm a positive guy, I'm not that fearful. I believe something will happen. I know the club is asking extremely hard, and unfortunately we can't go in Waitrose for five minutes and buy two very good players. It's a bit more complicated than that.\n\"I see the club is working hard, Daniel, Vinay and Johan - we're all on board in terms of being on board to see how we can improve.\"\nRicharlison had been mentioned as a potential makeweight in any deal for Eze, despite the Brazilian starting both of Spurs' two games so far - and scoring a superb double in the 3-0 win over Burnley last weekend.\nWhatver the reason behind those reports of his impending departure, Frank gave his own public backing to the forward when asked about his situation at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\"Right now, Richarlison is my starting No 9,\" he said. \"He scored two fantastic goals, had two fantastic games and is the Brazil No 9.\n\"He's a fantastic player, he wants to stay, I want to keep him and there's been no talks about anything else.\"",

        "content": "Sky Sports News has been told co-owner Evangelos Marinakis and the Nottingham Forest bosses are baffled by Nuno Espirito Santo's latest comments, and there has been no intention of sacking him as the club's manager.\nHowever, Nuno's words to the media on Friday, saying his relationship with the Forest owner is \"not the same\" and \"it is not so good as it was [last season]\" have caused some within the club to seriously question the 51-year-old's commitment to the job.\nDespite this, it looks unlikely Nuno will be sacked before Sunday's game with Crystal Palace, live on Sky Sports, unless he resigns from the role.\nSky Sports News understands discussions are happening behind the scenes, and it is a fast-moving situation.\nRegardless of Marinakis's obvious anger, he is keen to try to bring some kind of unity to the fore in time for the fixture against Palace.\nMarinakis does not want further distractions for the squad, which he, and many others, feel is the strongest Forest have had for decades.\nIt is also thought to be unlikely that Nuno will resign without the prospect of a payoff.\nNuno's comments, which sparked the current unrest behind the scenes at the City Ground, from the Forest boss came a week after he said in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports ahead of the opening game that his squad was \"unbalanced\" and \"very, very far\" from being ready for the new season.\n\nSince Nuno said that, Marinakis has sanctioned over £118m worth of spending on four new players in the last week. That level of spending, the Greek billionaire feels, is proof that Nuno still had his full confidence and backing.\nThe root of Nuno's upset is not wholly understood; however, it's thought he has a difficult relationship with Forest's new global head of football, Edu Gaspar, who was appointed last month to oversee the recruitment strategy for Forest and the other clubs in Marinakis' multi-club empire - Olympiakos in Greece and Rio Ave in Portugal.\nNevertheless, despite Edu's arrival, the club structure at the City Ground and Nuno's role have not changed.\nSince Nuno took over in December 2023, while he has had a say in transfer strategy and the players being targeted, his role has been to galvanise and organise that group of players as the head coach in charge of the first team.\nNuno said his relationship with Marinakis is \"not the same\" and admitted \"where there's smoke, there's fire\" in response to reports his position at the club is under threat.\n\"We know each other very well, and we have all been in the industry for a while now,\" he said ahead of Sunday's Premier League game at Crystal Palace.\n\n\"And where there's smoke, there's fire, so I know how things work, but I'm here to do my job. I understand, because I'm worried. I'm the first one to be worried. I'm the first one to be concerned.\"\nWhen questioned about the rift in his relationship with Marinakis, Nuno went on to add: \"I always had a very good relationship with the owner, last season was very close. This season, not so well. No, it's not [good].\n\"I don't know exactly, but I'm being honest with you. I cannot say that is the same, because it's not the same. The reason behind it, I don't know.\n\"I always believe that dialogue and what you say or your opinion, is always valid, because my concern is the squad and the season that we have ahead of us, but our relations have changed.\n\"I'm being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it's not the same.\n\"The reason behind it, I don't know.\n\"The reality is that it is not what it used to be. What it used to be was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it's not so good.\"\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett :\n\"It's bizarre. It's an extraordinary situation at Nottingham Forest. They had a fantastic win on the opening day of the season and are in the Europa League group stages.\n\"All things looked rosy. But suddenly, there are serious doubts about the future of Nuno Espirito Santo as the Nottingham Forest head coach.\n\"Evangelos Marinakis and the Nottingham Forest bosses are baffled by what he had to say to the media. There is no intention of sacking him.\n\"However, those words today have caused people within the club to question his commitment in the job going forward.\n\"It is extraordinary. I understand there is real anger at the timing of this.\n\"The headlines, as I see it, are that there is a growing rift between Marinakis and Nuno.\"",

I hope it does.\"\nWhen asked what the maximum punishment should be, Semenyo said: \"It could be jail time, it could be banned from stadiums for a lifetime, it could be anything along the lines of that, but I feel like there has to be something else.\"\nThe 25-year-old, who thanked the team-mates, opponents and fans who showed him support on the day, also revealed he was subjected to further abuse on social media in the aftermath of the incident.\n\"I feel like in this day and age it just doesn't make sense and we want to know why it keeps happening. It was pretty painful to hear,\" he said.\n\"I got back on the coach and I was just going through my messages. I wanted to reply back to family and friends, to be honest, and then it obviously popped across the screen on Instagram. I was getting racially abused as well, and it's just like straight after the game that's happened.\n\"Someone has felt the need to come online and do that, so that made me angry, to be honest. Why would you want to do that?\"\nAfter the match at Liverpool, Meta told Sky Sports News they are investigating the racist abuse sent to Semenyo on Instagram.\nIt's understood the social media company are removing comments and disabling the offending accounts.\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters warned any form of discriminatory language used inside a football ground will lead to an immediate ejection from the facility, a ban being issued and the individual may face criminal charges.\n\"No Premier League footballer should ever have to, in their workplace or online, suffer that sort of abuse. It is important that we keep saying that,\" Masters told BBC Sport on August 16.\n\"It is a problem for society. It leaks into football and it shouldn't happen in a football stadium. It shouldn't happen online.\n\"It makes people like me and other football people in charge of the game think twice about what else we can do to ensure that these things don't happen in the future.\n\"If you are found to be using discriminatory language inside a football ground you will be ejected, second you will be banned and third you may face criminal charges.\"",

        "title": "West Ham 1-5 Chelsea: Unwanted records, 'scandalous' defending and relegation fears for West Ham",
        "content": "There was \"scandalous\" defending on the pitch and \"sack the board\" chants from supporters leaving the London Stadium early, as West Ham were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea on Friday night.\nFans might wonder how, on an evening where their team were embarrassed by their rivals, no West Ham player was even booked.\nThe disastrous derby - on the back of a bruising 3-0 loss at newly-promoted Sunderland on the opening weekend - has already sparked talk of a relegation battle and under-pressure Graham Potter appears in desperate need of reinforcements before the transfer window closes in just over a week's time.\nBut with problems across the pitch and confidence battered, Potter now has a huge task on his hands to pick up his players before Tuesday's Carabao Cup trip to Wolves to stop this alarming start to the season spiralling out of control.\n\"I know we're only two games in, but that's a squad that's going to be in a relegation fight unless they give the manager some help,\" said Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp. \"They need four, five, six new signings. They haven't got the quality.\"\n\nThey didn't have the application on Friday night, either, with Redknapp slamming the defending from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jean-Clair Todibo in the first half. \"When your players are defending like that you have no chance,\" he said.\nNever before have West Ham conceded eight goals in their first two games of a top-flight season - but it was easy to see how they've managed it this time, with poor marking, a lack of intensity in their own box and an inability to be first or even second to crosses into the box.\nPhysically, the midfield was overpowered by a Chelsea team who only returned for pre-season a little over two and a half weeks ago. It is in desperate need of an injection of energy after also being found out at Sunderland.\n\n\"Fuming\" was the word captain Jarrod Bowen used to sum up his feelings about the whole situation. He had been feeding off scraps for most of the game, trying to make something happen amid his team's largely toothless attacking performance.\n\"We gifted the goals away,\" he said. \"Everyone has to look in the mirror and be brutally honest. We have to have a reaction.\"\nBut how likely is that to come?\nAs well as their record number of goals conceded this season, Potter now has the unwanted record of being the first West Ham manager to fail to reach double figures for points in his first 10 home games.\nHis overall record is the second-worst of any West Ham manager in the Premier League era.\n\"Clearly what we're doing at the moment isn't enough,\" he conceded in a deflated interview with Sky Sports .\nWest Ham fans booed the team off at half-time and the few remaining when the final whistle sounded did the same. They also turned their ire on the club's hierarchy.\nThis summer the club fulfilled their obligation to buy Todibo - who was hooked at half-time when Potter ditched his back-five plan - and paid fees for Malick Diouf and Mads Hermansen, the goalkeeper who was relegated with Leicester last season, spilled a cross for a Chelsea goal and who, according to Redknapp, needs to be taken out of the team.\n\nThe only other additions were the free signings of Kyle Walker-Peters and Callum Wilson.\nWith Mohammed Kudus, Aaron Cresswell, Vladimir Coufal, Lukasz Fabianski, Danny Ings, Kurt Zouma and Michail Antonio gone, it's fair to question whether West Ham's transfer business has left them weaker than they were before.\nThey are certainly in a worse position after Friday night. Alarm bells are ringing - and it's only August.",

        "title": "Viktor Gyokeres off the mark for Arsenal as Man City produce worrying display against Spurs - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nFollowing a difficult debut against Manchester United, Viktor Gyokeres endured more of the same in the first half of Arsenal's meeting with Leeds. There were heavy touches, a snatched shot inside the box and a general over-eagerness to impress.\nBut it only took three minutes of the second half for everything to change. Finally given a chance to run in behind by Riccardo Calafiori's ball over the top, the striker showcased his power and cutting edge, driving inside and sending a low finish past the goalkeeper.\n\"It's clear that Viktor is really dangerous,\" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta in his press conference afterwards. \"That's his superpower. Let's put him as much as possible in those kind of scenarios, because something will happen.\"\nKai Havertz's injury has added to the onus on Gyokeres' shoulders but this was exactly the response Arsenal needed. Clearly, there is still work to do to provide him with the level of service he requires. As at Old Trafford, his touch count was low against Leeds.\nBut his first goal altered the trajectory of his performance and Arteta will hope it serves as the lift-off he needs. The impact on his confidence could certainly be seen in the manner in which he dispatched the late penalty won by the brilliant Max Dowman.\nHe will need that same confidence at Anfield next weekend. But following a short pre-season, he is sharpening up physically too. \"It was important for me to get 90 minutes, get the rhythm and to get to know the team even more,\" he told Sky Sports . \"I felt more comfortable in how we're playing. I think you can see that as well.\" Nick Wright\n\nManchester City fans will have left the Etihad on Saturday with more questions than answers after a performance that was the complete antithesis of last weekend's win over Wolves. Creative, fluid patterns were replaced by unimaginative, misplaced passes.\nJames Trafford's mistake will hit hardest because it led to a goal but he was far from the worst offender. City were sloppy, undone by a team who looked more confident and assured in their specific roles.\nCristian Romero did a number on Erling Haaland. Joao Palhinha, who won more duels than any other player, and Rodrigo Bentancur were more assertive than Tijjani Reijnders and Nico Gonzalez in midfield. Mohammed Kudus more direct in attack.\nDefensively they were excellent, too, drawing particular acclaim from Thomas Frank for a 'top mentality'. No signs of Spursy Spurs here.\nAs for Man City, this is a confusing start. Are they back in contention as title candidates or was matchday one just a ruse? Pep Guardiola insisted his side would \"make the click\" - but offered no assurances as to when that might happen.\nUntil then, we will be left to ponder what this Man City side, complete with its extravagant summer remodel, are truly capable of. Laura Hunter\n\nSome players might be different but the ethos and tactics remain the same for Bournemouth. That is why perhaps the best bit of business the Cherries did this summer was to keep hold of Andoni Iraola. This was very much business as usual for them.\nWolves were swept away at times by the brave Bournemouth press and aggression without the ball. That was on show for the only goal of the game where Tyler Adams robbed Jean‐Ricner Bellegarde in a typical Iraola pressing trap that the visitors fell into. It ended up the game-winning moment. It's this style of football that has played a huge part in the captures of Ben Gannon-Doak and Amine Adli, who offered the home fans a glimpse of his talents in an impressive cameo. With Iraola at the helm, another season of excitement awaits. Lewis Jones\n\nThere was, understandably, some doom and gloom around the Gtech after Brentford saw Bryan Mbeumo leave for Man Utd this summer and then Yoane Wissa also ask to join Newcastle United, a double blow compounded by a limp opening-day loss at Nottingham Forest - but Dango Ouattara's impressive debut in the win against Aston Villa has given the Bees and new head coach Keith Andrews a real spring in their step.\nIt did cost the west London club £42m to replace Mbeumo with the Bournemouth forward, but that looks money well spent on the basis of his match-winning display that saw off Villa on Saturday afternoon to give Andrews his first win as the new Bees boss.\nIt was not just the confident manner in which the 23-year-old took his goal after being played clean through by Igor Thiago's clever flick that caught his boss' eye.\nBut also the way the Burkina Faso international spent much of the rest of the game tracking back, man-marking Lucas Digne and going on to win more duels than any of his team-mates, before rightly receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted late on.\n\"His goal will get the headlines but for me, it was the aspects of the game, the selfless nature of how he approached the game, and knew what was needed to get a result,\" Andrews said after the game.\n\"If he didn't stick to that it would've been very difficult to deal with them. He was amazing in the space of a few days [since joining]. I know he'll be a big player for this club, his attributes are there for everyone to see.\n\"You'll see that more as we get more control of games and feed him a bit more, but the out of possession shift he put in was selfless. I'm not too surprised, right from the first moment I spoke to him I was really impressed with him.\" Rich Morgan\nThe third statistic should worry Aston Villa more than the second because results will not follow until Unai Emery's side can look more dangerous.\nFor a second weekend in a row they were ineffective in front of goal and despite improving after a below-par first 45 at Brentford, managed just a solitary shot on target from their second-half showing.\nEmery pointed out after the game that the backs-to-the-wall shift the Bees put in was reminiscent of each of his side's visits to the Gtech since he took over.\nBut this victory for the hosts ended a six-game unbeaten streak for the Villans. Yes, these are normally tight affairs, but Villa normally have the guile to edge things.\nIt is easy to point to the loss of attacking players since the end of last season but this was still a line-up including Morgan Rogers and Youri Tielemans, with one of the Premier League's most willing runners - and deadliest finishers - in attack.\nOn the odd occasion, patterns of play worked well and they looked dangerous. But something is not clicking, and it's not just a lack of new faces. Ron Walker\n\nIt took until October for all three promoted sides to win a game in the Premier League last season. This season, it has only taken two weeks.\nBurnley, Sunderland and Leeds United have already won half as many home games as last Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton last season, too.\nIt is early days for the newly-promoted trio but all three teams are showing the bravery, determination and quality to secure points in the top-flight.\nWhether or not they can maintain this momentum throughout the course of the entire season remains to be seen. However, the early signs are promising.\nAll three promoted teams dropped back into the Championship last season - that might not be the case this time round. Patrick Rowe\nIt's mid-August and West Ham look like they're heading for a relegation fight. Just two games into the season, alarm bells are ringing and fans made their frustrations felt during the dismal thrashing by Chelsea.\nOn the pitch, there are goalkeeper questions, defensive lapses, a midfield lacking power and a toothless attack.\nOff it, head coach Graham Potter - who has the second-worst record of West Ham managers in the Premier League - is under pressure but can also point to an underwhelming window of transfer business.\nThe 3-0 loss at promoted Sunderland was a terrible start but the 5-1 dismantling by Chelsea will leave their followers wondering where they go next. It needs to be to the transfer market, if they are to significantly shift the way this season is going. Peter Smith",

        "content": "Arsenal have agreed a £67.5m deal to sign Eberechi Eze after hijacking Tottenham Hotspur's move for the Crystal Palace forward.\nThe Gunners will pay a guaranteed £60m plus £7.5m in add-ons for the forward, who completed his Arsenal medical on Saturday.\nEze has agreed terms on a long-term contract with a formal announcement expected soon.\nThe 27-year-old's release clause, worth £60m plus £8m in add-ons, expired before the Premier League season started.\nEze was absent from the Eagles squad as they beat Fredrikstad, in the first leg of their Conference League play-off at Selhurst Park on Thursday but was spotted at the ground after the game by Sky cameras.\n\nSpurs felt they had an agreement in place with Palace and Eze on Wednesday before their north London rivals reignited their interest and swooped in following an injury to Kai Havertz.\nEze was one of a number of players Arsenal looked into in the first few weeks of the window, where, significantly, a lot of the work was carried out in June when they explored the conditions of a deal. Since then, their focus has been on other positions and player departures.\nSpurs were considering offering Richarlison in a deal for Eze. That would have freed up striker space for them to try and sign Yoane Wissa, who played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Wissa still wants to join Newcastle, who had a second bid rejected on Wednesday.\nEze, who started in Palace's draw at Chelsea on Sunday, has two years left on his contract at Selhurst Park.\nArsenal have a long-standing interest in Eze, who was previously on the books of their academy and has said he was a supporter of the club growing up.\nThey explored a potential deal earlier in the window, but chose not to pursue a deal at that stage as they prioritised strengthening other areas of the squad and agreeing new contracts with existing players.\nSpurs then came in for Eze after Morgan Gibbs-White chose to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest and they lost James Maddison to an ACL injury.\nTalks were held between Tottenham and Palace, and Spurs felt they had an agreement in place on Wednesday with club and the player.\nHowever, Arsenal then came in to hijack the deal in a major twist on Wednesday evening.\nSky Sports' Peter Smith:\nEberechi Eze is electric. The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself.\nHe finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first ever major honour.\nLast season wasn't all plain sailing, though. \"I think Ebere has had a strange season,\" said Palace boss Glasner at the end of March. \"He hasn't had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He's also struggled with strange injuries.\"\nThose comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in an FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in.\nIt is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta.\nAfter being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second-chance in north London - and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Mikel Arteta.\n\nSky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:\n\" Arsenal have pulled off a real coup here. At the last minute, they matched Spurs' offer, and it's important to remember Eze himself is an Arsenal supporter.\n\"His wish was very important in this - Arsenal matched Spurs' bid of £60m, including £7.5m in add-ons. Remember, he had a release clause which expired last week, which was worth up to £68m.\n\"Arsenal have been interested in signing him all summer and their fans were crying out for them to make a move for him.\n\"When you looked at how much business they had already done this summer you could suggest they had to sell before they brought in another player.\n\"Is this move motivated by the fact Kai Havertz picked up this injury at Old Trafford? Or have they been really smart and avoided getting involved in a bidding war, and knew he would choose Arsenal if he had a choice, and waited for Spurs to agree a deal before they turn up at the 11th hour and matched it. I think it's a bit of both.\n\"I have some sympathy for Spurs. This is not football manager, this is real life. I don't want to kick Spurs when they're down - I'm trying to see it from the perspective of their hierarchy.\n\"I think they did everything they could to try to sell the club to Eze. A lot of Spurs fans are asking why they didn't trigger his release clause before Friday, but maybe they tried to do that and the player could've dragged his feet. Maybe he was keeping his options open.\n\"Spurs fans are very angry and criticising Daniel Levy and the owners, but I think we should keep things in perspective; these kind of things happen all the time in the window.\n\"Ultimately, everyone knows Eze is an Arsenal fan, as are his whole family. He played for them until he was 13 when he was released.\n\"Why didn't Spurs trigger the release clause? It might've needed paying in one lump sum. They might've waited until it expired to get a better deal.\"\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

Starting from the ownership, starting from Josh [Kroenke] and then all the board to recognise that we had to act.\n\"It was our choice, obviously.

It was very, very important. I'm delighted to have him. You can tell how much it means to him and his whole family.\n\"Welcome to our family and I'm sure we're going to have some great moments together.\"\nAsked about what Eze brings to Arsenal, Arteta said: \"The talent is unquestionable. He's done it in this league. The personality, unbelievable.\n\"He has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations.\n\"He's got that flair.

        "title": "Tottenham's perfect Premier League start continues and they have Thomas Frank to thank",
        "content": "For the second straight year Tottenham triumphed at the Etihad, beating Manchester City 2-0 with a composed and clinical performance to end City's 10-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League.\nSpurs are only the second side to win away to a Pep Guardiola-managed team in back-to-back seasons. And this one was far too easily achieved.\nCity fans will have left the Etihad on Saturday with more questions than answers after a performance that was the complete antithesis of last weekend's win over Wolves.\nCreative, fluid patterns that led to goal-scoring opportunities were replaced by unimaginative, misplaced passes, that resulted in very little positive. City underwhelmed for the majority, but you have to wonder how much of that underperformance was down to Spurs' organised and aggressive gameplan.\nFrom the first time James Trafford was offered the ball in open play, it was evident that Thomas Frank had directed his players to rush the City box. Richarlison nearly nicked the ball off his toe in the ninth minute of the game. They swarmed in packs and never let City settle, eventually forcing the mistake for Joao Palhinha to score a well-timed second goal. City had no response.\nThe visitors were content conceding possession, but hit City where it hurt, with more efforts at goal and a greater number of shots on target. Each of the two big chances they created ended in a goal. The two Man City generated ended in a miss.\nCity were being confronted by a team who looked more confident and assured in their specific roles, like they had played this way for years. Like it came naturally.\nCristian Romero did a number on Erling Haaland. Palhinha, who won more duels than any other player, and Rodrigo Bentancur were more assertive than Tijjani Reijnders and Nico Gonzalez in midfield. Mohammed Kudus more direct in attack.\n\"I have a feeling the performance was a little bit better than the result,\" reflected Guardiola, generously. His reading of the game will be incompatible with most others.\nSaturday's result was not only a statement victory for the Frank regime, but a triumph of managerial style.\nHaving also won with Brentford in November 2022, Frank becomes only the third manager to beat Guardiola away from home with two different clubs. There's no coincidence in that. \"I definitely believe in the aggressive press, as you saw today, and as you saw with my Brentford team,\" Frank told reporters at the Etihad.\n\"I believe in being front-footed. I like that mentality, it's a more offensive way of defending. It's more fun to defend on the opponents' half. So, yeah, let's go for it.\"\nSpurs may have started the campaign under the highly Spursy contradiction of having endured their worst domestic season for nearly 50 years, while simultaneously landing a first trophy since 2008, but Frank is out to change perceptions for good.\n\"We have been working so hard on our defensive principles. Mentality is the key thing - you need mentality to win games like this,\" he added.\nTottenham have long been mocked for an absence of big-game mindset. The term Spursy is rooted in that all-too-familiar shortcoming, evident just three weeks ago in Super Cup defeat to PSG after blowing a 2-0 lead.\nBut they have passed the real acid test with flying colours in these opening two weeks, with Frank's fingerprint also all over the 3-0 downing of Burnley.\n\nEven failed pursuits to sign a No 10 - losing out on Eberechi Eze to Arsenal just this week - have not derailed focus. Spurs' creative side has shone, scoring five times, while registering two clean sheets.\nSix points and a goal difference of +5 represents their best start to a league season. A small sample size, yes, but a big change in identity and fortitude. The question now will be: how long can it last?",

        "content": "Arsenal's injury concerns deepened further on Saturday Night Football as Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard were taken off against Leeds.\nGunners captain Odegaard went down under a challenge in the first half and suffered a shoulder injury, coming off having initially played on.\nArsenal's woes worsened in the second half when Saka - who had scored Arsenal's second goal on the stroke of half-time - went down with an issue in his left hamstring.\nThe England international missed four months of last season with a serious hamstring injury, and was replaced by Leandro Trossard in the 53rd minute.\n\"Martin felt something in his shoulder when he landed,\" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, who added the captain would have a scan on Sunday.\n\"Bukayo, carrying the ball, felt something in his hamstring. I think it's the other one, not the same as the previous injury.\n\"He felt something sprinting, that's never a good sign. We have to speak to the doctors [on Sunday]. Let's wait.\"\nReacting to Saka's injury, Gary Neville said on co-commentary on Sky Sports : \"You can read his lips. He said: 'Oh my God'. This is something he doesn't like. He's a tough kid. He doesn't go down injured easily, if ever.\"\n\nAnd Sky Sports' Nick Wright added: \"Saka looks worried as he goes off. So do the Arsenal fans around us. There are a few words in the ear of Arteta and his assistant, then it's down the tunnel, shaking his head as he goes.\"\nOnce again, the injury issues for Arsenal are piling up ahead of an early season showdown with Liverpool next weekend, live on Super Sunday.\nKai Havertz had already been ruled out ahead of the game against Leeds, although the extent of his injury has not yet been revealed.\n\"In two weeks, already we lost Kai [Havertz], Bukayo, Martin,\" said Arteta. \"It shows how well equipped you have to be in this league.\"\n\nSummer signing Christian Norgaard is also yet to make his debut as he continues to recover from an injury, while Ben White did not pass a late fitness test for Saturday's game.\nJurrien Timber's minutes are continuing to be managed - although he scored twice and assisted against Leeds - while Gabriel Jesus continues his recovery from an ACL injury.\nThe injury concerns come after a jubilant pre-match introduction of Eberechi Eze , who was introduced to the home crowd wearing the No 10 shirt after signing from Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nSky Sports' Jamie Redknapp:\n\"They need Eze. He may start at Anfield. I would like to see him play centrally. It could be difficult for him to play wide. Right now the player under a little bit of pressure is Martin Odegaard. He'll be looking at Eze thinking he could be a problem for me. If you asked Eze, he'd want to play centrally.\n\"There are lots of players that can come in but there's only one Bukayo Saka. When he had surgery on his other hamstring, it deflated the whole team - they weren't the same and lost a goal threat.\n\"He was their talisman. Saka is the one that when he gets the ball everything will be alright. To not have him at Anfield will be a major blow.\"\n\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta on new signing Eberechi Eze:\n\"The talent is unquestionable. He's done it in this league. The personality, unbelievable.\n\"He has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations.\n\"He's got that flair. He's got that charisma as well about him that is very contagious.\"",

        "title": "Alexander Isak: Newcastle striker wants to leave amid Liverpool interest - but what happens now?",
        "content": "Liverpool would have hoped to have Alexander Isak lining up for them against Newcastle on Monday Night Football this evening - but the Swedish forward remains in a transfer stand-off with the Magpies with a week to go until Deadline Day.\nIsak put out an explosive statement last Tuesday regarding the ongoing saga, saying his Newcastle career \"cannot continue\" following \"broken promises\" made by the club.\nThis is after Liverpool saw a £110m bid rejected by Newcastle earlier this summer.\n\nIsak has not yet featured for Eddie Howe's side in matches since Newcastle returned to pre-season duty. He has been spotted at the club's training ground but has trained away from the first team, who have started the new Premier League season in his absence.\nSo have Isak's latest comments put the Liverpool move back on? If a deal does not happen, is there any way back for Isak at Newcastle this season? And crucially, how big a few weeks is this in the context of the Premier League title?\nSky Sports answers all the key questions below - as we all start deliberating: what is next?\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nThere is a blurring of the lines about this. In his statement, Isak's section was somewhat ambiguous regarding the \"broken promises\" that have been reneged on. Newcastle clarified in their own statement they have not communicated any promise to Isak about him leaving the club.\nHowever, it is our understanding that Isak's claims of broken promises relate to a contract renewal that was discussed with the club. He claims he was promised a new deal which he has wanted for the last 18 months - and that hasn't materialised.\nIsak feels he wants a contract - with higher wages - that reflects his status as one of the top Premier League strikers.\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nNewcastle have been angered by what Isak said on his social media - and have dug their heels in.\nNewcastle are in a strong position, which is what they were saying in their club statement. Isak has three years left on that existing six-year contract that he signed. And they remain very calm on the situation despite the outside noise.\nThis is a situation where Newcastle have tried this summer to try and find a replacement, to allow Isak to then leave.\nThey tried to sign Hugo Ekitike, who would have been a like-for-like replacement. They tried to sign Benjamin Sesko, who would have been a like-for-like replacement. And they've got right down to the nitty-gritty in both those deals and lost out, ironically, to Liverpool and then to Manchester United respectively.\n\nNeither of these players were being bought to play alongside Isak, they were bought to facilitate Isak's move away. And either of those deals would have allowed Isak to join Liverpool - but the failure to get Ekitike or Sesko has left Newcastle in a difficult situation.\nNewcastle feel that they have scoured the market but there is now a private resignation that there is no one else left for them to pursue as a top target.\nRight now, Newcastle need Isak. And it feels very much like in this current climate, Isak will remain a Newcastle player beyond the end of the transfer window.\nWhat will be really interesting will be if and when Isak returns to the pitch wearing black and white stripes. Newcastle fans called him a \"greedy b******\" from the stands during last weekend's 0-0 draw against Aston Villa - a match which showcased how much Newcastle need him.\n\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett:\nFrom a legal standpoint, there is very little Alexander Isak can do to get out of his Newcastle contract.\nReports have suggested the striker had a verbal agreement with the club to leave this summer.\nNewcastle denied that any such commitment was made to the player in their statement responding to Isak's post on Instagram.\nLegally, such an arrangement - if it did exist - is irrelevant to a player's contract and in no way binding under Premier League rules.\nThere are only two scenarios in which a player can annul their contract - when they haven't been paid or the club has breached the terms of the contract - and neither seem to be valid in Isak's case.\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nNewcastle spoke in their statement about the conditions of a sale. There were two conditions.\nOne, Newcastle's valuation of the player.\nThat valuation is £150m. But they would probably do a deal for a little bit less than that, though Liverpool's £110m offer that landed a few weeks ago is way short. So if Liverpool were to really seriously want Isak, they would have to come to the table with a higher bid.\nThe second is that Newcastle need to find a replacement .\nThey've been trying to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford. But he's seen as the Callum Wilson replacement rather than the Isak replacement. So they're actually even struggling to bring in a replacement for Wilson, who left on a free contract and has joined West Ham.\nSo Isak would be allowed to go if:\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nIf Newcastle sign two strikers between now and the end of the window - and that's unlikely in the time left, which Newcastle alluded to in their statement - then Isak is likely to go.\nBut if they get one striker, such as Wissa, who they have made a new bid for, and Liverpool make an eye-watering offer for Isak - of around £130m to £135m - then Newcastle might have a big decision to make.\nThere is an outside chance of Isak's departure happening in those circumstances. But it would leave Newcastle very light on striker reinforcements.\nNewcastle had a bid of £35m, plus add-ons, rejected by Brentford last Wednesday.\nIt's going to be a very tense last week, it feels like a line in the sand was drawn from both parties last night, and Newcastle's stance on the issue has hardened on the back of Isak's statements. There is a feeling that Isak has done himself no favours by making that statement.\n\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nThere is a stalemate in this saga: a player who does not want to play anymore and a club that does not want to sell him. Both are trying to achieve their aims at any cost.\nThere have been plenty of incidents in the past where players have dug their heels in, refused to train in the hope of getting a move. See Dimitar Berbatov , who missed the start of Spurs' season in 2008/09 to get a move to Manchester United.\nThere was even one earlier this summer in the form of Viktor Gyokeres , who did not turn up to the start of Sporting CP's pre-season training.\n\nNoises emerged of a broken agreement about his value between the player and the club - with Gyokeres winning that battle by getting a £63.5m move to Arsenal.\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nThere have been some high-profile instances where the club have stayed resilient and won in the face of player power. In 2021, Harry Kane expressed his desire to leave Tottenham and did not even show up for the first day of pre-season training, for which he was fined.\nLike Isak's situation, City had put in a £100m bid for Kane - who also had three years left on his contract.\nAnd while Spurs looked for centre forward replacements in the window, they stood firm and ended up keeping Kane after bids kept on being rejected. The England captain would end up leaving two years later for that same £100m fee to Bayern Munich.\nThere was another incident where the club won out in Carlos Tevez at Manchester City. In September 2011, the Argentine refused to come off the bench against Bayern Munich and manager Roberto Mancini insisted Tevez was \"finished\" at the club.\nAfter refusing to apologise and receiving multiple fines from City over breaches of contract, Tevez returned to Argentina without permission from the club. Months went by without a resolution but City rejected approaches from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain for Tevez in the January transfer window.\nTwo weeks after the transfer deadline, Tevez returned to City and then apologised for his conduct. He was back in Mancini's team by March and then helped them to a first Premier League title that season.\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\nThere is a growing feeling among the wider public that Isak's behaviour is unacceptable and this could even impact fan sentiment on Merseyside.\nHowever, speaking to Sky Sports News last week, Jamie Carragher felt Isak's tactics would be unlikely to lead to Liverpool's interest being affected.\n\"They won't, whether we think they should or shouldn't,\" he said, before making it clear he didn't agree with the approach.\n\"I don't think when you have a club paying your wages and supporters paying to watch you play you should refuse to play or train. I don't think that's acceptable.\"\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\nLiverpool have already been busy in the transfer market this summer, making significant changes in the forward positions. The acquisitions of Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz have encouraged supporters but there have also been some high-profile departures.\nDarwin Nunez and Luis Diaz have been sold, while, of course, Diogo Jota tragically passed away at the start of July. In a recent interview with Sky Sports, Arne Slot argued that Liverpool were still short up front. \"We need to have one more attacker,\" he said.\n\nIsak's firepower would be an asset for any team and Liverpool believe that he could be a difference maker. They won the Premier League title by 10 points having scored 17 more goals than second-placed Arsenal but Slot's view is that the margins were small.\n\"Although we have created the most chances in the league, scored the most goals in the league, we have mostly won games by one goal difference.\" In fact, nine of Liverpool's 25 Premier League victories last season came by just one goal.\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\nLiverpool have already committed £79m to bringing in Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt and the France international forward has made a promising start to life at Anfield with goals in his first two games for the club. Many would argue that he warrants a run.\nSlot himself has acknowledged that Ekitike's best position is up front but he also pointed out that there are other ways that the flexible forward can fit in. \"I see Hugo mainly as a No 9 who could also play from the left or with another No 9,\" told Sky Sports .\nWatch Newcastle vs Liverpool live on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football next week from 6.30pm, kick-off 8pm",

        "title": "Nuno Espirito Santo: Nottingham Forest boss reveals he wants to remain in charge with talks to be held",
        "content": "Nuno Espirito Santo insists he wants to stay in charge of Nottingham Forest and has revealed he will hold talks with owner Evangelos Marinakis and transfer chief Edu Gaspar to resolve his future.\n\nOn Friday, Nuno poured fuel on speculation that his job was under threat, saying “where there’s smoke, there’s fire”.\n\nIn a remarkable press conference, he also said his relationship with Marinakis was \"not the same\" and \"it is not so good as it was [last season]\", causing some within the club to seriously question the 51-year-old's commitment to the job.\n\n\nBut ahead of Sunday's match at Crystal Palace, Nuno said he is committed to Forest and believes talks with the club's hierarchy will put an end to the unrest around his job.\nAsked by Sky Sports in his pre-match interview at Selhurst Park over whether he was trying to engineer an exit from Forest, he replied: \"That's nonsense, that doesn't make any kind of sense.\n\"The state is that we are focused on the game, that's more important.\"\nQuestioned if he wants to continue as Forest head coach, he said: \"Of course! Of course!\"\nAsked whether he would hold face-to-face talks with Marinakis and Edu, he responded: \"Yes. That's what we need to do, and we're going to do it.\n\"Not today, of course, because it's the match, but soon, of course.\nThe Portuguese added: \"There's no speculation around anything. What we have is to communicate - how we're going to approach the final days of the market, how we're going to approach the new season, how we're going to prepare our boys.\"\nNuno doubled down on his pre-match comments when asked after his side rescued a 1-1 draw at Palace.\n\"This narrative is absurd,\" Nuno said.\n\"I wouldn't ever walk away. I don't know how many years I have of coaching, and many of you guys have known me for many years. Now I came to Wolves and the Championship. I love what I do. The moment that I don't enjoy it, it's over.\"\nHowever, when asked whether he believes he'd be Forest boss come the end of the transfer window, Nuno could not provide any assurances over his future.\n\"I cannot answer that question, but what I know is that I'm working and trying to do my job the best that I can.\n\"Of course, the situation has to be solved, and we are responsible persons, we're going to have a good conversation to try to create more than anything, a good platform for what is more important, the team.\"\n\nNuno also insisted his relationship with Marinakis can be repaired, having described it as \"not the same\" earlier in the week.\n\"Everybody wants the best for Forest. Me first, and the president first, and all the club wants the best for Forest.\n\"I think it's the first time that I'm facing the situation and being asked these things; it's not helpful. But I believe work with conflict doesn't work out. We have to create harmony. We need it.\n\"They [Forest hierarchy] were here today. We showed Forest is. For us, in these days, since the press conference, what is really important.\n\"The players, the fans, they were here supporting the team. The players show character and ambition, and commitment. We played a good game. We have a good platform to move forward.\"\n\n\nSky Sports News has been told Marinakis and the Nottingham Forest bosses are baffled by Nuno's latest comments, and there has been no intention of sacking him as the club's manager.\nSky Sports News also understands discussions are happening behind the scenes, and it is a fast-moving situation.\nRegardless of Marinakis' obvious anger, he was keen to try to bring some kind of unity to the fore ahead of the visit to Palace.\nMarinakis does not want further distractions for the squad, which he, and many others, feel is the strongest Forest have had for decades.\nIt is also thought to be unlikely that Nuno will resign without the prospect of a payoff.\n\nNuno's comments, which sparked the current unrest behind the scenes at the City Ground, came a week after he said in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports ahead of the opening game that his squad was \"unbalanced\" and \"very, very far\" from being ready for the new season.\nSince Nuno said that, Marinakis has sanctioned over £118m worth of spending on four new players in the last week. That level of spending, the Greek billionaire feels, is proof that Nuno still had his full confidence and backing.\nThe root of Nuno's upset is not wholly understood; however, it's thought he has a difficult relationship with Forest's new global head of football, Edu, who was appointed last month to oversee the recruitment strategy for Forest and the other clubs in Marinakis' multi-club empire - Olympiakos in Greece and Rio Ave in Portugal.\nNevertheless, despite Edu's arrival, the club structure at the City Ground and Nuno's role have not changed.\nSince Nuno took over in December 2023, while he has had a say in transfer strategy and the players being targeted, his role has been to galvanise and organise that group of players as the head coach in charge of the first team.\n\n\n",

        "title": "Manchester United attack still a work in progress after draw at Fulham as Jack Grealish shines - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\n\"We are going to score goals because we are creating so many chances.\"\nRuben Amorim is convinced Manchester United's attack will fire this season. The evidence suggests it will. They threatened to run riot in the opening 15 minutes at Fulham, but a concern is how they've faded in games.\nMatheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes were purring early on at Craven Cottage. Cunha went close three times. The quartet linked up with speed and precision around the box. They looked sharp.\nBut it didn't last once Fulham settled and stifled Casemiro and Fernandes with their midfield diamond. Ruben Amorim's substitutions also weren't able to have the same impact as Fulham's, Emile Smith Rowe equalising with his first touch.\nBenjamin Sesko came off the bench early in the second half but had just one touch in the opposition box - it wasn't a telling one.\nLast weekend, United's possession was in the spotlight, racking up 60 per cent against a traditional top-four side for the first time in almost a decade. It helped them get the ball into dangerous areas and fire off 22 shots.\nThis time it was different, over 10 per cent less as they were out-passed by Fulham, not by much, but with only 10 shots to show from it. Amorim's side remain a work in progess. David Richardson\n\nJack Grealish received the biggest cheer even before Everton kicked off against Brighton in the first Premier League game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium but the cheers were bigger in the 93rd minute as he left the field after a player-of-the-match performance.\nThe winger picked up two assists in Everton's 2-0 win - as many as in the previous two seasons combined at Manchester City. Had Dwight McNeil converted a late chance, it would have been a hat-trick of assists for the first time since his Aston Villa days.\n\"I hope he has got more of them to come,\" said David Moyes afterwards, acknowledging that Grealish gives this Everton something different. \"The big thing is he ball-carried for us. He retained the ball for us as well which gave us a little bit more composure.\"\nIt is no great surprise that Grealish showed good technique. The only question was how he would approach this challenge after the disappointment of finding himself surplus to requirements at City. But he showed that he had the stomach for the fight too.\nHe was tracking back inside two minutes. Putting in a tackle inside his own box just after the hour. \"He was game for it, didn't try to shirk anything, didn't want off after 60 minutes, didn't want any of that,\" said Moyes. \"No chance, he wants to show that he's the real deal.\n\"You know, you admire somebody who's saying, he probably has something to prove. I had something to prove, I think, over the years at different times. Sometimes it gives you that challenge that you have to try and be ready to take. Hopefully, Jack is.\" Adam Bate\n\nAnthony Elanga, who? Dan Ndoye is beginning to impress, filling the hole left by the Swede. With two games, he's already registered two goal contributions. After a debut goal against Brentford and an assist against Palace, he became the first Nottingham Forest player to score or assist in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since 1998.\nElanga's attributes were clear and Ndoye perhaps doesn't possess the blistering speed that Newcastle's summer signing has.\nHowever, Ndoye's adaptability will impress Nuno, who can continue to hope for an interchanging and dynamic forward line.\nNdoye's first-half display saw him marshalled out of the game. However, all it took was a tweak from Nuno to switch him and Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ndoye's individual brilliance did the rest to carve out the assist that earned Forest a point.\nNuno wants more in the door in terms of transfers but at present Ndoye for £34m looks like a masterstroke. William Bitibiri\nWithin the whirlwind that Crystal Palace have caught themselves up in this summer, it's been too easy to forget the fine work that is still being accomplished at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace continued an unbeaten start to the season.\nWhether it's the demotion to the Conference League or Palace's biggest stars being linked and in Eberechi Eze's case, securing a move away, the Eagles have navigated a strong start to the season. Their four games unbeaten are reflective of the mentality Glasner has developed in SE25.\nA win in the Community Shield saw Palace fight back to take Premier League Champions Liverpool to penalties. Their opening league fixture at Chelsea saw them controversially denied a point at the home of the world champions.\nA first game in Europe followed with Eze's future an acceptable distraction but still Palace secured victory. Against Forest, Palace will feel they dropped two points against a side that scored with their only shot on target. But Oliver Glasner will see the positives in their display.\nTheir start is a total contrast to the beginnings of last campaign, where a slow start brought Glasner into question. Their recent run represents a growing consistency that is going under the radar. William Bitibiri\nTo not score a goal from an expected goals figure of 2.46 was quite an achievement by Brighton.\nNot since Manchester City created 2.92 at Crystal Palace in March 2022 had a team in the Premier League created such a high xG figure without scoring away from home.\nPerhaps the footballing gods were working their magic for Everton on their big day so Brighton didn't really stand a chance but Fabian Hurzeler will be worried about the flakiness of his forwards.\nDanny Welbeck was responsible for 1.54 of that expected goals figure, missing from almost under the crossbar with the goal gaping and also from the penalty spot.\nHurzeler will be hoping it was just one of those days at the office rather than anything too deep-rooted. Lewis Jones\nMarco Silva deserves a lot of credit for how his Fulham side have battled to start the Premier League season.\nTwo games with two late goals to rescue a point on both occasions, they could have easily walked away empty-handed.\nSilva has been vocal about the need for reinforcements within his squad, with Benjamin Lecomte their only addition throughout the summer, and spoke openly about it after full-time against Manchester United, too.\n\"We need to sign two or three players,\" he said in his post-match press conference. \"We have eight or nine days to correct some things.\n\"We have a lot of games and have injuries; in some positions, we are short.\"\nReturns for Antonee Robinson and Ryan Sessegnon, as well as a boost in confidence for Emile Smith Rowe following his goal, will ease the strain on his squad.\nHowever, if they want to start converting draws into wins, fresh faces will be needed.\nThey had the momentum to win this fixture but just lacked the final push in the latter stages of the game.

        "title": "Russell Martin: Rangers boss reveals Hamza Igamane sub frustration and questions commitment of players",
        "content": "Russell Martin questioned the commitment of some of his Rangers players after revealing he couldn't bring on Hamza Igamane during the 1-1 draw with St Mirren because the forward told him he was injured.\nIgamane was named on the bench for the trip to Paisley but didn't make an appearance, despite the fact the visitors looked short of ideas in attack for much of the game.\nEighteen-year-old Findlay Curtis would end up coming on and scored shortly after to salvage a point for Rangers, who are without a win in their first three league games of the season for the first time since 1989.\n\nHowever, Martin couldn't hide his frustration over the situation after the final whistle and told Sky Sports he felt some of his players had one foot out the door.\n\"Hamza told me he was injured,\" explained the Rangers boss.\n\n\"We had a bid this week for Hamza, we rejected it. All was fine. Trained fine yesterday [Saturday], warmed up fine. I turned around to him at 60 minutes because I wanted two strikers on the pitch. Hamza told me he was injured.\n\"I don't know [if he refused to play.] I have to trust him but we'll see. The issue is that the transfer window is still open. There are a lot of people, one eye out the door and one in and we need people to be all in all the time in this football club.\n\"We really need that. At the minute there's still too many people uncertain or still trying to think, 'maybe there's something there for me'. The window needs to shut quickly.\n\"In-house we need to make sure that we have people who really want to be here, so the people that come in and the people that stay really want to be here. We'll see.\n\"I think there's a few areas we're looking to strengthen. I don't think anything's imminent being really honest. We've spoken to a few people. I know it's a boring answer but it's me being honest with you. I don't know what the Hamza situation will be after today.\"\n\nSky Sports Kris Boyd :\n\"I think I said it a couple of weeks ago, I think the players have been running the club for far too long. Listen, if he's injured, he's injured. I highly doubt it.\n\"If that is the case, if I'm Rangers Football Club I'd drive him to the airport and say goodbye. If you've not got people who are willing to knuckle down and help this team at this moment of time, then see you later.\n\"If you don't there's a real danger. It's at boiling point right now with the fans. If Russell Martin is not strong, and doesn't see this through, he's going to join Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Michael Beale, Philippe Clement out the door.\n\"He needs to get the right type of characters in this dressing room and quick. I do question if Martin is a little too honest. After a game, emotions are still high and if you've turned to your bench for a striker that the fans think is the blue-eyed boy; I've not seen what everybody thinks.\n\"On a consistent basis, Hamza Igamane hasn't done what everyone thinks he's done for Rangers. He's another one who is inflated and everybody thinks is better than he is.\"\nBefore the game, Martin demanded more energy from his players than what was on display in midweek against Club Brugge in the Champions League. And long before he turned to Igamane to potentially make an impact off the bench, they were off the pace.\nMartin admitted post-match that his players struggled to deal with setbacks during games and was critical of their immediate response to going behind. However, attention was quickly shifted to Igamane's injury, which led Chris Sutton to ask whether Martin was deflecting from another poor performance.\nAfter the draw against Motherwell on the opening day of the Scottish Premiership season, Martin warned his squad that there would be people \"left behind\" if they didn't want to be part of turning the club's fortunes around.\nMuch of that rhetoric was on display again from the ex-Southampton boss, as he continued to question the attitude and dedication of his playing staff. The reality, though, is that after nine games in charge, he has created history - the wrong kind of history - becoming the first permanent manager in the club's history to win just three times over that period.\nWhile question marks will no doubt fall on Martin, with season-defining games on the horizon, the Rangers boss may need to change his tune or further risk losing the dressing room and the Ibrox faithful.",

        "title": "Fulham 1-1 Man Utd: Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva fume over Rodrigo Muniz own goal after ‘clear foul’ by Leny Yoro",
        "content": "Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva both felt Manchester United's opener at Fulham should have been ruled out for a clear push by Leny Yoro in the build-up - on an afternoon of officiating controversy at Craven Cottage.\nIn the pulsating 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage, Yoro appeared to have two hands in the back of Fulham defender Bassey as he met a United corner, before forcing a Rodrigo Muniz own goal. VAR Darren England approved the goal after a brief check.\nBut Bassey felt referee Chris Kavanagh \"will be disappointed\" when they look back at the decision - especially as the Fulham defender was penalised for a shove on Mason Mount in the first half which gave United a penalty - that Bruno Fernandes missed.\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the game, Bassey said on the Yoro incident: \"It's a foul. He pushed me to stop me from getting to the ball. When the ref looks back on it, he will be disappointed. I can't say too much before I get a fine!\n\n\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He [Yoro] has got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.\n\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports about the Yoro incident, Fulham boss Silva added: \"The way the goal came and all that stuff, it's a clear foul. The boys reacted very, very well.\n\n\"I cannot understand it. I would love to explain everything to you from the first whistle to the last. But I don't have this. It's not my job, I don't want to go in this direction for everything that went on this afternoon at Craven Cottage.\"\nAnalysing the United goal on co-commentary duty, Gary Neville said: \"If I was Fulham, I would be asking about the two hands in Bassey's back.\n\"Both hands on the back and Yoro is lucky to get away with that, but he will not care.\"\nSky Sports News has approached the PGMOL for comment.\n\nBassey was also at the centre of VAR controversy as he was accused by the officials of bringing down Mount in the penalty area.\nAs per PGMOL guidance, referees will award more penalties for holding this season - in an attempt to crack down on grappling at set-pieces.\n\nReferee Kavanagh did not award the shove on Mount in real time but - two minutes after the incident, the official was sent to the VAR monitor during the next available break in play.\n\"I still think it's harsh,\" said Bassey about the incident. \"I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.\n\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.\n\"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be won, sometimes you're trying to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.\n\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.\n\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"\nAsked if he was relieved at Fernandes then missing the penalty, Bassey replied: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"\n\nThere was even controversy as Fernandes stepped up to take the spot-kick, with the United captain colliding with referee Kavanagh in the build-up.\nAnalysing the incident on co-commentary duty, Neville said: \"He picked the ball up, and maybe the referee has given him a bump by accident. And he goes back, it unnerved him a little bit.\n\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but [a few seconds later] he was still having a go at the referee, Fernandes - as he feels it was a little bit clumsy. That is maybe what put him off.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the game, Fernandes said: \"I was upset. As a penalty-taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do.\n\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.\n\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"\nAsked for his take on the incident, United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"I think he's not used to missing a penalty. He knows that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team.\n\"I felt that during the game he was not so happy, not so involved, because he had so much responsibility and he felt the missed penalty was huge for us.\"\nWatch Dermot Gallagher analyse the incidents in Fulham 1-1 Man Utd as well as all the other refereeing points from the Premier League weekend on Sky Sports News at 9am on Monday morning",

        "content": "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.\nEmile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.\nThe opening-weekend performance at Old Trafford offered encouragement as new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo impressed, but Sky Sports pundit Neville felt Sunday's game highlighted familiar problems - particularly in midfield.\nRuben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.\n\n\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast .\n\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.\n\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.\n\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.\n\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.\n\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.\n\n\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.\n\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"\nFor the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.\nThe Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.\n\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.\n\"Sesko, at the moment, let's just say it, he's nowhere near in terms of fitness or just getting up to speed.\"\nNeville feels the striker will need to be given more minutes to build his fitness, starting in Wednesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie away to Grimbsy Town.\n\"Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him,\" said Neville. \"Last week, I was saying, 'look, let's just get him straight in'.\n\"He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.\n\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football.\n\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.\n\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"\nNeville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.\nThe skipper blasted his effort over the bar after referee Chris Kavanagh had bumped into him as he prepared to take it, with Fernandes later telling Sky Sports he was \"upset\" not to receive an apology from the official.\n\"I think he let it impact him,\" said Neville. \"I thought he let it get to him. When he came out for the second half, he was still talking to the referee.\n\n\"I know that can happen, but I think you can see in his face sometimes with Bruno that he wears his heart on his sleeve and it was quite clear that obviously he's desperately disappointed about missing the penalty in the way in which he did.\n\"Sometimes, if a goalkeeper saves it you might think, 'OK, that happened', but he's smashed it over the bar, and then there was this idea that the referee disrupted his rhythm.\n\"It was a complete accident. Obviously the referee was trying to walk back towards the players coming in.\n\"He just seemed to let it impact him in the game and I think that's just something that shouldn't have happened really, but that wasn't the biggest problem out there for United today.\"",

        "title": "Viktor Gyokeres' runs for Arsenal, James Garner's flexibility and Adrien Truffert's overlapping runs feature in The Debrief",
        "content": "Welcome to The Debrief , a Sky Sports column in which Adam Bate uses a blend of data and opinion to reflect on some of the key stories from the latest Premier League matches. This week:\nThe whispers about Viktor Gyokeres had already begun by the time he cut inside to score for Arsenal on his Premier League home debut. An hour at Manchester United followed by 45 minutes without a goal against Leeds was enough for pressure to build.\nBut after adding a stoppage-time penalty, the record reads two goals from two games. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had called it. \"I think we are going to be extremely happy when he starts to put the ball in the back of the net very, very often which is his biggest ability.\"\nEveryone had argued Arsenal needed a natural goalscorer. Finding a way to incorporate him without losing what makes Arteta's side so good was always going to be the challenge. Even at this early stage of the season, there are signs it could be a delicate balancing act.\nGyokeres is different to Arsenal's other options. The statistics highlight that clearly. The Sweden international has made 27 runs challenging the backline so far this Premier League season - the most by any player in the competition. One brought his first goal.\nRiccardo Calafiori's first-time pass behind Leeds' high defensive line gave Gyokeres something to chase. \"It is almost his signature move,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports . \"He wants to run the other way.\" But Arsenal players are not so used to seeking out this movement.\nAlthough Gabriel Martinelli makes that run from out to in, it is more usual for Kai Havertz to come towards the ball. Arsenal need to get used to looking for that pass. \"I think we need to make an effort as well to try to understand him, to connect,\" admitted Arteta.\nThe stats also show that the majority of those Gyokeres runs did not result in a pass being sent his way. And even when the striker has received the ball, he has been among the most isolated players in the Premier League so far. That connection must improve.\nArteta appears aware of the issue and one would expect a better understanding with his new team-mates to emerge in time. \"We have done a lot of work this week in relation to that as well. I am sure he is going to be fine. He is a very smart, intuitive player.\"\nPerhaps a little \"scruffy\" - as Gary Neville put it on co-commentary for Sky Sports . But Arsenal have enough class and cuteness elsewhere in their squad. Now they have the hammer as well as the scalpel, cutting through teams should be more straightforward.\n\nOne of football's classic lines came courtesy of Hector Enrique, the Argentina midfielder who stabbed the ball in the direction of Diego Maradona prior to his 'Goal of the Century' against England at the 1986 World Cup. \"With a pass like that, how could he miss?\"\nJames Garner's strike against Brighton was not exactly Maradona dancing through the opposition from inside his own half but, unlike Enrique, much of the credit for this goal has gone to Jack Grealish for rolling the ball into his path. Let's give Garner his flowers too.\nIt was not just that his tremendous strike sealed the 2-0 victory for Everton in the first Premier League game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Garner's goal came in a game in which he was filling in at left-back, given the daunting task of marking Yankuba Minteh.\nPutting that matter to Moyes afterwards, he replied: \"Probably the biggest thing for me is getting a result today when we have got half a botched team out in some ways. We have got players missing who would be in. We are having to play players out of position.\"\nHe added: \"We have been struggling probably since the end of last season, all through the summer and we still are now. So, Jimmy Garner's performance was fabulous because I thought he played well on Monday night as well. I thought he did a great job.\"\nGarner stuck to his task and gave Grealish plenty of support too. No Everton player had more touches than he did, feeding the ball to the England winger and often playing simple passes to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in what looks like a promising combination.\n\nWithout Vitalii Mykolenko, Nathan Patterson and Jarrad Branthwaite, Moyes has had to turn to Garner in yet another different role. His natural position is in midfield but needs must. \"His versatility is so important to us,\" said Moyes.\n\"He has got the ability to score, he always has had, and he got a good goal. It is good because he is really a midfield player so to get his first goal on the board today is great. We want our midfield players to start getting much more goals.\" Even from left-back.\n\nSpeaking of left-backs, Bournemouth have found another one following the sale of Milos Kerkez to Liverpool. Adrien Truffert, the 23-year-old France international signed from Rennes, delivered another strong performance on his home debut against Wolves.\nNeville had already picked out Truffert as his one to watch this season on Monday Night Football after an adventurous display against Liverpool - in a game in which Kerkez was hooked by his new club. He looked a threat going forward in the win over Wolves too.\nTruffert has made 17 overlapping runs already this season, six more than any other player in the Premier League. Remarkably, he has also made the second most underlapping runs. Whenever Bournemouth have the ball out wide, he is going to go. The ideal replacement.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.",

        "title": "Max Dowman joins Bukayo Saka, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly in showing Arsenal's Hale End academy is their biggest asset",
        "content": "The Emirates Stadium crackled with anticipation every time the ball arrived at the feet of Max Dowman. As in Arsenal's pre-season games, his team-mates made a concerted effort to put it there. It is easy to understand why. The 15-year-old is a special talent.\nDowman became the second-youngest player in Premier League history with his introduction against Leeds, a huge achievement in itself. But most remarkable is that, as well as being Arsenal's youngest player, he once again looked their most dangerous.\nLeeds could not contain him. The drop of the shoulder to win Arsenal's late penalty capped a thrilling debut. On a day of theatre, of unveilings, injuries and first goals, it was Dowman, a schoolboy still four months shy of his 16th birthday, who stole the show.\n\"This is what we see every single day in training,\" smiled Mikel Arteta afterwards. It is something else, though, to do it on this stage. \"He is so convinced that he can go at 15 and deliver that, which I never witnessed in my life,\" added the Arsenal manager.\n\nDowman might be Arsenal's most exciting academy product yet. He certainly looks uniquely ready for the step up at his age. But he is just the latest player off the club's production line in recent years.\nHale End continues to deliver.\nIn the closing stages of Saturday's game, Dowman was one of three teenaged academy graduates on the pitch for Arsenal along with Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly, both of whom are already established at senior level, relative veterans at 18.\nBukayo Saka, an inspiration to all three having become a talismanic figure for the club and its youth set-up, had earlier scored the second goal before being forced off injured. In new signing Eberechi Eze, there was another former Hale Ender watching on.\n\nEze is different, of course, in that he had to leave, aged 13, to make it at senior level. But his connected past makes his return all the more intoxicating to the club's supporters. He was greeted on Saturday as a boyhood fan as well as a former academy player.\nIn the matchday programme, Arsenal's co-chair Josh Kroenke had spoken about the importance of tying Lewis-Skelly and Nwaneri to new contracts. \"They know what it means to be Arsenal,\" he said. So does Eze. The club is woven into his DNA too.\n\"It brings joy, it brings emotion,\" said Arteta afterwards. He was referencing Dowman's emergence but the same can be applied to any one of the club's academy products.\n\nTheir instant bond with the club and its supporters is of course only one part of their offering. Saka, Nwaneri, Lewis-Skelly and Dowman, carefully nurtured by Arsenal since childhood, have added immense quality to the squad at no cost in transfer fees.\nAt only 15, Dowman is too young for a valuation. A player cannot command a transfer fee until he has signed his first professional contract after turning 16. All that can wait for him.\nBut it is dizzying to ponder the heights he might reach, and just how much he might bring to a squad already rated as the world's second-most valuable after that of Real Madrid.\nArsenal have assembled a group of players worth £1.14bn for transfer fees totalling £826m. No other Premier League even comes close in terms of squad value generated compared to cost.\nIt is largely thanks to their blossoming academy products.\nSaka is now valued at £129.3m by Transfermarkt , reflecting his status as one of the world's best players. Still only 23, he remains the academy's jewel, his peak years still to come.\nNwaneri and Lewis-Skelly have some way to go to reach Saka's heights but their trajectories, at 18, are not dissimilar. The former is valued at £48m; the latter £39m. The hope is that they will continue to grow and develop, and that Dowman will be next.\nThe players and their families are of course the key drivers in their success. Together, they also reflect the excellent work of academy director Per Mertesacker and the various coaches who oversaw their progress through the age groups at Hale End.\nBut they also require a manager willing to trust them and they have that in Arteta, whose close relationship with Mertesacker has helped ensure alignment between the academy and the senior side, opening a clear pathway into the first-team.\nSince the start of last season, Arsenal have given more minutes to players aged 18 or under than any other Premier League side. Even academy players who have moved on, such as Emile Smith Rowe and Eddie Nketiah, have generated value through their sales.\nUnusually for a first-team manager, Arteta has taken an active role in meetings with players such as Nwaneri and Lewis-Skelly from a young age, long before they joined the senior squad. But it is since their promotions that their progress has really accelerated.\nIt is partly down to the exposure but Arteta's coaching has helped too. Saka was playing at full-back when Arteta arrived at the club but has flourished as a right-sided forward. Lewis-Skelly, previously a central midfielder, has been reinvented as a left-back.\n\nIt remains to be seen where Dowman's long-term future lies. He has so far been used in Saka's role, cutting inside from the right, onto his left foot. But he can also play centrally, either as a No 8 or a No 10.\nThe possibilities are tantalising. He will of course need to be protected given his age. Dowman is still a year away from sitting his GCSEs. But clearly he has a role to play even in the short-term.\nEvents at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday were a reminder that Arsenal's academy is key to their present as well as their future.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Championship talking points: Frank Lampard's Coventry sparkle, Millwall show steel and Middlesbrough stay perfect",
        "content": "\n\nResult: Coventry 7-1 QPR\nCoventry have now scored 12 goals in their first three Championship games. That stat is made even more impressive by the fact their opener was a goalless draw.\nFrank Lampard's side followed up last week's 5-3 win at Derby with a 7-1 shellacking of sorry QPR. Five goals coming in the first half, and any hope of the away side salvaging any dignity ended by a sixth within minutes of the restart.\n\"Probably the first 45 minutes here was the best we've played since I've been here,\" said Lampard. It had every facet of our game that we talk about, that we work on, everything on the mentality side of it, how at it we were - you could feel the energy on the pitch.\n\"I'm pleased because we as staff have spoken to the players a lot in these opening weeks about what we demand, the standards we want to bring every week consistently, and today we showed it.\"\nThe CBS Arena was, understandably, in a boisterous mood. Fit for a party after the club had announced earlier in the day that they had completed the purchase of their stadium - meaning that they finally own their home for the first time since it was built 20 years ago.\nLampard might be slightly concerned that Jack Rudoni, attracting interest, may be drawing slightly too much attention as Deadline Day looms. If he can keep his squad together then Coventry might well possess the most fearsome attacking line in the Championship. Times are good for the Sky Blues. Simeon Gholam\n\nResult: Charlton 0-1 Leicester\nLeicester's display at Charlton was suggestive of a difficult near-future if the Foxes fail to adequately replace Bilal El Khannouss. The forward was absent from the squad amid intense rumours of a move to Crystal Palace.\nFrom the player's perspective, it would be a deserved return to the Premier League for a player who shone in a dimly-performing Leicester team last term.\nHowever, for the club they lose a creative spark - evident in their at-times laboured approach against Charlton. Marti Cifuentes' side expectedly dominated the ball but, for all their possession, they looked predictable in the final third until Abdul Fatawu's stunning winner.\nBefore then, Fatawu - and Jeremy Monga on the other flank - had struggled to get into the game. But his individual brilliance proved the importance of ensuring he remains at the King Power Stadium past Deadline Day.\n\"It was a fantastic goal which summarises really well what Abdul means to us,\" said Marti Cifuentes afterwards.\n\"If I had to trust all the rumours and speculation then (head of media relations) Jonny (Lally), you have to start next weekend. There is speculation around most of our players.\n\"The target is that we arrive on September 1 in a good position with a team that we want to have. There are some key players that we want to keep and Abdul is one of them.\"\nPrior to the game, Cifuentes spoke of a need for reinforcements as the window draws to a close - that need did not change despite bouncing back from a loss at Preston to win in the Championship. Will Bitibiri\n\nResult: Sheff Utd 0-1 Millwall\nThere were five Millwall first-teamers out injured at Bramall Lane on Saturday. But the headline absence from the starting XI was Japhet Tanganga, who is on course to join Sheffield United, with a fee agreed between both clubs for the standout defender.\nIn those circumstances, and after being beaten 3-0 at home last week, many outsiders would have anticipated another difficult afternoon for Millwall at a Sheffield United side desperate for a result.\nBut instead, Millwall showed their resilience. A well-taken Luke Cundle goal in the first half gave the visitors something to hold onto and an inspired performance by goalkeeper Steven Benda backed up a well-organised and determined defensive display.\nThis was no smash-and-grab, though. Despite having just 39 per cent possession, Millwall finished the game having had more shots and more shots on target. The overall trend is upwards under the management of Alex Neil and the travelling supporters paid tribute to the latest effort at full-time - while also teasing Tanganga about his next career move.\n\"When this club's got adversity against us, it's probably when we're at our best,\" said Neil, after his side demonstrated just that in this important fixture. Peter Smith\n\nResult: Derby 1-1 Bristol City\nBristol City boss Gerhard Struber made little effort to hide where he wants to strengthen before the transfer window closes after watching his side gradually cede momentum to drop two late points at Derby on Friday.\nCity had been in the ascendency, and a goal ahead, when first-choice forward Emil Riis was forced off by injury nine minutes into the second half.\nIn his absence, City produced an xG of just 0.22, dropping deeper and deeper and eventually succumbing to Carlton Morris' equaliser four minutes from time, leaving it plain to see where the Robins' shortcomings lie even after a positive summer of incomings at Ashton Gate.\n\"When Emil went off, it's not so easy in our striker position [to] have someone behind him who is also on this level at the moment,\" he told the BBC after the game. \"It's somewhere where we had to do something.\"\nOf Struber's other options, Sinclair Armstrong remains an enigma but is extremely rough around the edges, Fally Mayulu appears again appears to have fallen out of favour and Sam Bell has precious little experience as a No 9 at this level.\nThe message from Struber was abundantly clear. The only question lies in whether he will get what he desires by September 1. Ron Walker\n\nResult: West Brom 1-1 Portsmouth\nWest Brom head coach Ryan Mason was sent off in the Baggies' draw against Portsmouth after an angry response to two big decisions not going their way, both for challenges on Aune Heggebo.\nSpeaking on Ref Watch, former England striker Jay Bothroyd sympathised with Mason.\nOn the first incident, when West Brom were denied a penalty after a foul by Connor Ogilvie, he said: \"The first one is ridiculous. I don't understand how the referee doesn't see that. That is one of the most obvious decisions we'll see all season.\"\nHeggebo was then manhandled and pulled back by Regan Poole, who was the last man.\n\n\"If he goes down there, he makes the referee have to make a decision,\" Bothroyd added.\n\"He stays strong, he's trying to be honest, he stands on his feet. He's gone through and had a shot, which is blocked. Ultimately, the referee should then bring that back. It's a red card.\n\"If the defender doesn't put his arms out and he doesn't grapple with him, he's going to take a touch forward and end up having a shot and he might score.\n\"It's still difficult as he's outside the area. It's still not an easy chance, but he's the last man.\"\nFormer Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher said he would be \"absolutely amazed\" if Mason's red card was rescinded. Dan Long\n\nResult: Norwich City 1-2 Middlesbrough\nThree from three for Middlesbrough! Two goals in quick succession at the end of the first half secured Rob Edwards' side their third win of the season and second successive away win - it's no wonder the Boro' faithful were in fine voice in the away end long after the final whistle.\nIt was an end-to-end game in the first half, before Middlesbrough broke the deadlock with some lovely one-touch football before Finn Azaz finished the move. They added a second minutes later when Aiden Morris won the ball back high and crossed it to Tommy Conway to finish from close range.\nNorwich already had an uphill battle to face in the second half, and things got even more difficult when Jacob Wright was shown a red card for his challenge on Aidan Morris.\nThe home side did rally late on, though, through the man they are so desperate to keep in Norwich colours, Josh Sargent. He dinked the ball into the back of the net following a long ball from Kenny McClean.\nHowever, it proved to be too little too late, and Middlesbrough's perfect start continues. Harriet Prior\n\nResult: Birmingham 1-0 Oxford\nIf you'd stumbled into St Andrew's on Saturday afternoon unaware which of these teams was the newly promoted side, you'd never have guessed it was Birmingham City who were playing League One football last season.\nIn fact, this was similar to a lot of games they played at that level - Chris Davies's side felt in complete control throughout, too strong, too quick, too good on the ball for Oxford who were kept at arms length.\nThe only negative was that they didn't add to Paik Seung-Ho's well-taken opener, Kyogo Furuhashi the biggest culprit in spurning two excellent first-half opportunities. But Mark Harris couldn't convert the one late chance that came Oxford's way and their head coach Gary Rowett remains the last Birmingham manager to lose a home league game some 27 matches ago.\nOxford are one of two pointless teams left in the Championship having lost their opening three matches of a season for the first time in seven years. Time to panic? Maybe not just yet. Rob Jones\nFriday\nSaturday",

        "title": "Scotland: Aaron Hickey, Ben Gannon Doak, Ryan Christie return for World Cup qualifiers away to Denmark and Belarus",
        "content": "Head coach Steve Clarke has recalled a host of familiar faces ahead of Scotland's opening World Cup qualifiers.\nBrentford right-back Aaron Hickey makes a welcome return after almost two years away from the squad following a long-term injury.\nWinger Ben Gannon Doak , who has just joined Bournemouth from Liverpool in a deal worth £25m , is also back for the first time since November.\nDoak's new club team-mate Ryan Christie missed the last camp but is now in line to make his 60th cap for the national side.\nThe goalkeeping department has caused boss Clarke some recent headaches - and they could continue next month.\nHe had given Cieran Slicker a debut against Iceland - but that didn't go to plan for the 22-year-old , and while Ross Doohan also featured in the June friendlies, he is now a back-up at Celtic.\nWhile they both drop out, Angus Gunn retains his place, but the 29-year-old has not featured for Nottingham Forest since his move in the summer - casting doubt over his readiness.\nCraig Gordon had reclaimed the gloves for Scotland's last six competitive matches. However, the 42-year-old is injured, meaning Hearts team-mate Zander Clark returns and could add to his four caps - having featured in every league game for his club this season.\nRangers' Liam Kelly is also in the squad, but is second choice at Ibrox and made just one League Cup appearance this campaign - leaving Clarke with a big call to make.\nBlackburn Rovers' Dominic Hyam makes a return for the first time in over two years in defence, alongside the likes of Hibernian's Grant Hanley , captain Andy Robertson, Celtic's Kieran Tierney and John Souttar of Rangers.\nHowever, there is no space for Everton's Nathan Patterson or Ryan Porteous who has just moved to Los Angeles.\nAt the other end of the field, Scotland fans have long awaited a prolific goalscorer. However, there is new hope that Hibernian's Kieron Bowie could fill that void.\nHe has two goals in two league games so far, plus scored a contender for goal of the season in their Conference League qualifier against Partizan.\nBowie made his debut in the 4-0 win over Liechtenstein and will be joined by Lyndon Dykes , George Hirst and Che Adams as Clarke's forward options, as Hearts' Lawrence Shankland misses out.\nLennon Miller , who moved to Udinese in a £4.7m move this month , retains his place. He's one of five players who play in the Serie A, with Ballon d'Or nominee Scott McTominay and his Napoli team-mate Billy Gilmour also in the group.\nGoalkeepers: Zander Clark (Hearts), Angus Gunn (Nottingham Forest), Liam Kelly (Rangers).\nDefenders: Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Dominic Hyam (Blackburn Rovers), Max Johnston (Sturm Graz), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic).\nMidfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Lennon Miller (Udinese).\nForwards: Che Adams (Torino), Kieron Bowie (Hibernian), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham), George Hirst (Ipswich).\nScotland boss Clarke insists he is relishing the pressure of being the person responsible for delivering Scotland's men's side to a World Cup Finals for the first time since 1998.\nHe said: \"You live on pressure in this game. If you don't thrive on the pressure, you're probably better hanging up your boots - or in my case, my whistle and stopwatch.\n\"It is something that comes with the territory. I mentioned pressure, but I also mentioned excitement because you're excited for the challenge. It is a really short qualifying campaign, six games, and we'll be ready to go.\n\"It would be great [to lead Scotland to the World Cup]. We want to be in the major tournaments - we have spoken about it. It was 1998 since the last World Cup - that's a long time, too long - so hopefully this time we can put it right.\"\n\nCaptain Andy Robertson remains optimistic about Scotland's hopes of World Cup qualification despite admitting recent results have not been \"up to scratch\".\nThey slumped to a 3-1 defeat to Iceland at Hampden Park before a 4-0 win against Liechtenstein , a team ranked 205th in the world.\nScotland have won just four of their last 16 games and at home the record stands at one victory in nine.\n\"I'm still optimistic, I'm still looking forward to the future,\" he told Sky Sports News at his AR26 golf day.\n\"We know maybe the last year and stuff hasn't been up to scratch but I still believe in the squad that we've got. I do believe that we can cause any team problems as long as we get back to the basics that we're good at.\n\"We know how hard it is to qualify for a World Cup.\n\"The last time we tried it, we had a pretty perfect campaign, only finishing a couple of points behind Denmark. We then go into the play-offs and we know how hard the games in the play-offs are.\n\"But if we get back to doing what we're good at, back to our basics, back to our basic principles, then I do believe we can give anyone a game.\n\"I think we've shown that at the highest level. We've drawn against Portugal, beaten Croatia, beat Spain.\n\"I know that feels a long time ago, but we have competed against teams when we do that right and that's what we're going to need to do for all six games to give ourselves a chance.\"",

        "title": "Evangelos Marinakis and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest storm at a lull, for now - Reporter Notebook",
        "content": "After a week where it felt like Nottingham Forest were trying to self-destruct, there is an awkward ceasefire at the City Ground as all sides plan their next manoeuvre. How lasting that truce is remains to be seen.\nThe situation is still very unpredictable, with two passionate and volatile characters at odds with each other - owner Evangelos Marinakis and manager Nuno Espirito Santo. That relationship has deteriorated for sure, possibly irrecoverably, and long term there are serious question marks about how long the Portuguese coach will continue in his role.\nBut for now, Sky Sports News has been told that there is an air of \"business as usual\" at the City Ground, with the bosses knowing that what has happened in the last 10 days has seriously impacted the stability among the squad, and the mood around the entire club.\n\nNuno has now said publicly what we reported on Friday - that he will categorically not resign . \"Never. It is absurd.\" And so if he is to leave Forest, Marinakis will have to sack him and pay him off. There is no imminent sign of the Greek billionaire wanting to do that. His mantra has always been that disagreements should be aired behind closed doors, so as to show no chink in the armour of unity. And so the manager speaking out so bluntly, and so personally, has angered him greatly.\nThere are, however, conciliatory noises coming from the manager now - he says he wants a meeting to clear the air with the owner and Edu - global head of football for all of Marinakis' clubs. But it is far from clear when that will happen. There is no such meeting currently scheduled. And it is that relationship - Nuno versus Edu - which is at the heart of the problem here.\nWhen Edu took over last month, Nuno was already in post, and he'd just signed a new contract the month before. In football - like in many other industries - when a new boss comes in, they tend to want to employ their own people. That unsettled Nuno from the start, and crucially it put a middle-man (a barrier, in Nuno's eyes) between himself and the big boss. He felt undermined, and sidelined. But what is more damaging for Forest - and a very difficult situation for Marinakis to manage - is that fundamentally Edu and Nuno do not like each other. There is a clash of character. And when that happens, it is usually the boss who wins in the long run. Edu is very obviously Nuno's boss.\nThose differences may have been put aside for now, but you sense the resentment will linger. Marinakis is not a man who takes kindly to being criticised, especially in public, and especially from his senior people. Nuno has done it twice in the space of a week.\n\nOn the eve of the opening match, he shocked Forest fans - and the owner - by openly criticising the club's lack of transfer business. He was clearly taking aim at Edu, but he hit Marinakis in the crossfire. Four new signings at a cost of £118m followed in the next week, but at his next pre-match news conference, Nuno dropped another bombshell - his relationship with the owner had deteriorated, he said: they were \"not close\", and it \"had changed\" . And when asked about a report in Spain, suggesting he was soon to be sacked, he said \"there is no smoke without fire.\"\nThe 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace saw James McAtee, Omari Hutchinson and Arnaud Kalimuendo all make their debuts, with new midfielder Douglas Luiz an unused sub. Despite that, and despite eight new signings this summer, Nuno said post-match that he still wants a new goalkeeper and two new full-backs before the transfer window closes on Monday. He is keeping the pressure up on Edu for sure.\nThe owner was never going to react quickly to Friday's criticisms and sack the manager two days before a Premier League game. But Marinakis now has a little more breathing space to consider his options - especially with the first international break of the season just a week away. That pause in the season could be crucial in seeing the relationship either mended or broken.\nMarinakis will have noticed the raucous support for Nuno from the away supporters following at Selhurst Park, with a noisy rendition of \"Nuno, Nuno, Nuno\" coming from the stands after full-time as the manager went to applaud the fans. But the owner will also have noticed a growing split in the fanbase on social media, with a growing minority speaking out against the behaviour of a man who has delivered European football, and guided the team to their highest league position since the mid-1990s.\n\nThere is currently a lull after the most bizarre and unexpected storm. But if there's one thing we have learned about the current Forest - the only certain thing is that nothing is certain.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Wolves have rejected a £50m bid from Newcastle for Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nWolves' position is that he is not for sale in this window. They believe he is too important and the lack of time left in the window is not enough to find a Premier League-ready replacement.\nWolves exercised their option to buy Strand Larsen on July 1 from Celta Vigo for £23m, after the 25-year-old Norway international spent last season at Molineux on loan.\nHe scored 14 Premier League goals in 35 appearances in 2024/25 and has started both Wolves games so far this season.\nNewcastle are targeting Strand Larsen as the replacement for Callum Wilson.\nYoane Wissa has been another player they see potentially coming in for Wilson, however Brentford rejected a £40m bid for the striker last week.\nStrand Larsen has started both of Wolves' league games so far this term.\n\nSky Sports' Adam Bate at Wolves' training ground:\nVitor Pereira has made it clear how important Jorgen Strand Larsen is to Wolves, but stopped short of guaranteeing that the Norwegian striker would remain at the club this summer amid reports of interest from Newcastle.\n\"He's a very important player for us. I never talk with him about it. He's our player. When I watch him on the training, he's committed with everybody, committed with the team. He's a fighter. He likes to win. He's preparing himself to play tomorrow.\"\nAsked if Wolves could afford to lose a key player between now and the end of the transfer window, Pereira added: \"I don't know. The market is the market. If the window is open, the players can come and the players can leave. I believe this is possible.\"\n\nEddie Howe is confident that Newcastle will not leave him without a recognised striker as the Alexander Isak situation rumbles on.\nIsak was the subject of a £110m bid from Liverpool and has not featured for Howe's first-team in a match since the Magpies players returned from pre-season.\nHowe was asked if there is a situation where Isak is sold and Newcastle do not bring a replacement in.\n\"I don't think the club will allow that situation to happen,\" he said.\n\"We certainly can't go through the season with no recognised striker at the football club - and that's no disrespect to Will Osula.\n\"I think he's doing really well and he's progressing really well, but he's got limited experience in the Premier League, although I'm really happy with his career progression.\n\"But Alex at the moment would be the only striker we have with Premier League history of goals and appearances and starts, so we can't leave ourselves in that position.\"\nSky Sports News reporter Keith Downie:\n\"For Newcastle, it feels very much at the moment like spinning plates. We don't yet know what is going to happen with Isak whether he will remain a Newcastle United player or not but they're ensuring that they're doing everything they can to get in replacements should he move to Liverpool.\n\"It will be interesting to see whether Newcastle go in with an improved bid for Strand Larsen - clearly Howe looking for striking reinforcements.\n\"They don't want to overspend though. I spoke to him just a couple of days ago in the build-up to this game. He said they don't want to overspend but they know they need strikers in because they're playing not just in the Premier League this season but they've got a Champions League campaign to contend with as well.\"\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Jamie Carragher says Newcastle should sell wantaway striker Alexander Isak before Monday's transfer deadline, comparing his situation to that of Fernando Torres at Liverpool.\nIsak has been subject of a £110m bid from Liverpool this summer, with the club also signing Hugo Ekitike after Newcastle had been strongly linked with the striker as a potential replacement for Isak.\nThe Sweden international has not been involved with the first team since the end of last season, instead training away from his team-mates with his future unresolved.\nIn a twist of fate - and with a week to go until Deadline Day - Newcastle and Liverpool face each other on Monday Night Football, and Sky Sports' Carragher offered his views on Isak's situation ahead of the game.\n\"I don't think a deal was ever going to get done before this game. I could not see that. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few days,\" he said.\n\"I can't believe that for Liverpool it is just Isak or no one but it does feel like that the closer we get to the end of the window.\n\n\"Thierry Henry said that Isak is a must for Liverpool. I have never been of that opinion - [I am] one of the few Liverpool fans who is all in on Isak and we have to spend this money.\n\"I don't think he is as durable as someone like Mo Salah. Actually, over the last three seasons he has missed 36 league games. It is almost a season out of three seasons.\n\"But I think Newcastle should sell Isak.\n\"There will be so many people outside telling Newcastle and Eddie Howe what they need to do. You have to be strong. You have to show Liverpool or any other club that players cannot just come in and demand to go.\n\"But they don't have the problem of Isak every day. They don't have the problem that Eddie Howe has of going to every press conference and being asked about it. It is a cloud over the club constantly.\n\"I have experience of it. We had this with Fernando Torres at Liverpool, where he did not really want to be at the club.\n\"He ended up staying and we sold him in the January. Those four or five months were a nightmare for the club and everyone could not wait for him to move on.\n\"It is similar to Newcastle. As a club, they are delighted to be in the Champions League and Isak is a player who wants to win it. They are not there now and he is 25 going on 26.\n\n\"When we were going for the Champions League, we had some world-class players. As soon as our level dropped, people like Torres, [Javier] Mascherano and [Xabi] Alonso - world-class players - wanted to leave because there was too much of a gap between where they are as players and where the club are.\n\"So it is not just me having a go at Newcastle and wanting their player to come to Liverpool, I have experience of that situation and when you have a player who does not want to be there it can be an absolute nightmare.\"\nFormer Arsenal striker Henry called Isak one the Premier League's best strikers right now, and agreed with Carragher that it is best if he leaves Newcastle.\n\"He's up there with, if not the, best striker in the league at the moment,\" he said on Monday Night Football.\n\"He's a great striker. What he can give you off and on the ball, the way he finishes, but when you have a player in this type of situation where he wants to leave, it's good that people are getting upset, because when a player is not good and a club wants him out, I don't see anyone crying for the player.\n\n\"I can understand the fans and the club, but I also can understand him. You always put yourself in a situation as a player where people might not understand if you don't come to training.\n\"We never know the whole story, but all I say is that you cannot put yourself in a situation when you don't come to train.\n\"In an ideal world, the best thing for him and for everybody is if he can leave, but I also do believe that when someone makes a mistake, if he apologises, then we can move on.\n\"If he scores goals and he starts to play the same way he played last year, the Newcastle fans will be OK about it.\"",

I felt the club already, even before I was in the building, just from social media and from people telling me about the club. I've never been so excited to play football and I'm just ready to get going.\n“I think it's the perfect match because of where the club is right now. Obviously with the new stadium, the fans here are unreal and it has a family feel to it. I think it was the perfect fit and was a no-brainer to join.\n“I think I’ve come to Everton at the perfect time and hopefully I can be here for many years.\n“[The Brighton win] gave me a feel for the club. It looked unbelievable. I also played in the last men’s game at Goodison. It was so loud. I was looking around and thinking, 'This is quality'. That was a really good insight for me into what it's like here with the fans and the atmosphere they can create.\n\n“There's no better feeling than when you're doing well in football and to feel that love from the fans is one of the best feelings ever. I'm excited to play here.”\nThe England U21 international made his first-team debut for Southampton as a 17-year-old in August 2023.\nOn working with Everton boss David Moyes, he said: “I think the manager is perfect for me. Obviously he's helped so many players before who were in my position. I've spoken to him and I know he's going to be good for me.\n“There are so many players here to learn from, real quality players like Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye.\n“I’d say the wow factor in my game is my dribbling. That’s what I’m best at and that’s what I want to excite the fans, and I hope I’ll get to do a lot of it.\n“My aim for this season is just to play as many games as I can and to help the team as much as I can with goals and assists. As a team, hopefully we can have a good season and see where it goes.”\n\n\nOn his latest addition, Moyes said: “We are really pleased to bring Tyler to Everton Football Club. He is a talented young English player with lots of potential.\n“Tyler adds to our attacking options and we will support him in his future development.\n“We are eager to build a team that Evertonians can enjoy watching and be proud of, and Tyler can help us achieve that.”\n\n\n\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Arne Slot criticised Newcastle's approach in Liverpool's dramatic 3-2 win at St James' Park, declaring \"that wasn't a football match\" when asked for his assessment of the game.\nLiverpool came away with a victory against 10-man Newcastle on Monday Night Football after the Magpies thought they had come from 2-0 down to secure a draw.\nSixteen-year-old Rio Ngumoha's winner 10 minutes into injury-time capped off a raucous, chaotic game that had been dominated by the future of Alexander Isak beforehand.\nThe Toon comeback was even more impressive given they played half of the game with 10 men after makeshift No 9 Anthony Gordon was sent off in first-half injury-time.\nIt was a scrappy affair from the outset with 19 fouls before the break. Newcastle then resorted their attacking play to purely set-pieces with a man fewer - a tactic that caused Liverpool problems and led to the two goals that levelled the game.\n\nAlso, the ball was in play for just 40.8 per cent of the game, which was the lowest percentage in a Premier League match since February 2010 (40 per cent in Stoke 3-0 Blackburn).\nSlot said: \"I'm not too sure if I saw a football match today. It was set-piece after set-piece, long throw.\n\"It didn't have a lot to do with tactics, what I said before the game, but I liked a lot how we stood strong. Very difficult first half hour, 45 minutes, but we didn't collapse at all, we stood strong.\n\"Going down to 10 men, you would expect that that is a big plus for us, but when a goalkeeper takes every free kick, then there's not so much help if you are one player up, and that's why it was so difficult for us to bring the 2-0 over the line.\"\nHe added: \"I don't think there was so much open play to be played.\n\"In a set-piece, a long throw-in, a long ball from the goalkeeper, you don't need an extra man. It's always nice to have an extra player on hand, but it's just not as beneficial as if they want to bring the ball out from the back and we can press them. So, yes, with the ball, the one and only attack that was good in the second half, apart from maybe the 2-0, that was the one that led to the goal, which was a great attack.\n\"And for the first time, we went from right to the middle to the left, and a great goal for a 16-year-old.\n\"Maybe it wasn't the best game in terms of tactics or in terms of playing football, but I think every fan everywhere around the world enjoyed watching this game of football, also because their fans were amazing in terms of the help they gave the home team.\"\n\nSky Sports' Jamie Carragher:\n\"There are people for Liverpool who have made a really poor start to the season. Mo Salah is one of them even though he has got a goal and an assist. [Ibrahima] Konate is another one. He has been all over the place.\n\"I want my centre-back to go and win that [challenge on Dan Burn for Newcastle's equaliser]. He was all over the place last week. He is more interested in grabbing his arm. He was really poor in the first half as well. He is not at the races at all.\n\"I absolutely shudder to think where Liverpool would be without Virgil van Dijk who has been absolutely outstanding.\"\nNewcastle head coach Eddie Howe to Sky Sports:\n\"A bruising game for us with so many different emotions.\n\"I'm really proud of the performance, really pleased with how we played, great energy, great intensity, really pleased with the following of the game plan and then adapting because we go to 10 men and for me we're the better team in the second half as well as the first.\n\n\"To come away with nothing and injuries and suspensions and concussions, it's a pretty bad day.\"",

        "title": "Rio Ngumoha: Who is 16-year-old Liverpool winger and how did he break into Arne Slot's first-team squad?",
        "content": "Despite spending just shy of £300m in this transfer window on new signings, it was Rio Ngumoha who stepped up when Liverpool needed him most.\nIn the 100th minute in a topsy-turvy game at Newcastle, the 16-year-old was the coolest man in the St James' Park cauldron as he curled home the winner in a dramatic 3-2 victory for Arne Slot's Premier League champions.\nIt was the latest standout moment in a stellar summer for the teenager. Three goals, including two stunning individual efforts, and two more assists in pre-season offered a glimpse into the mercurial talent that has already left a huge impression on the club's fans.\n\nBut Ngumoha has shown he can do it on the biggest stage.\nDirect, dynamic and a maturity beyond his years best describe Ngumoha's game - all traits that led Liverpool to poach the winger from Chelsea last summer.\nSo, what do we know about Ngumoha? And how much more might we see of him this Premier League season?\n\nNgumoha, born in Newham, east London, joined Chelsea aged eight. The wide man, who represented England at youth level, quickly rose through the ranks with the west Londoners, featuring for the club's U21 side at just 15 years old.\nHowever, Ngumoha opted to join Liverpool in the summer of 2024 after the Reds went all out to convince him to move to Merseyside, with former Chelsea captain John Terry, who has been involved in the Blues' academy set-up, predicting he would go on to become a \"top, top player\".\nNgumoha is understood to have been attracted by the proven pathway from Liverpool's youth ranks to the first team, as seen on numerous occasions during previous manager Jurgen Klopp's time in charge, while Slot has also demonstrated a willingness to give youth a chance since replacing the German at Anfield last summer.\n\nStarting out initially with Liverpool's U18 side, Ngumoha has enjoyed a rapid rise to the club's first-team picture since making the move north.\nSlot believed Ngumoha would benefit hugely from getting the opportunity to learn from players like Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, understanding exactly what one needs to do to be ready to perform every three days at the highest level.\nAs a result, in December of last year Ngumoha was named on the bench as Liverpool travelled to Southampton for a Carabao Cup clash, before becoming the Reds' youngest-ever player to start a competitive fixture when Accrington Stanley visited Anfield for an FA Cup third-round tie in January.\nAnd since his debut at the turn of the year, the wide man has been splitting training time between the academy and first team.\nNgumoha was then included in the Liverpool squad for the pre-season tour to Hong Kong and Japan this summer, with Luis Diaz's exit to Bayern Munich providing the perfect opportunity for Slot to slowly integrate the left-sided forward into the first team.\nAnd boy has the 16-year-old grabbed that chance with both hands, scoring eye-catching solo strikes in wins against Yokohama F Marinos and Athletic Club that showed just why Chelsea were so reluctant to see him leave their academy last summer.\nIn fact, the youngster needed only five minutes to register a goal and assist against Athletic at Anfield, with Ben Gannon Doak - now at Bournemouth - singing his praises, telling LFCTV: \"That guy is ridiculous. He is going to have some career ahead of him!\n\"So sharp and so talented. If he can keep going the way he is going, anything is possible.\"\nSlot has understandably at times this summer tried to dampen down expectations around Nguhoma given how intense the Premier League can be a lot for players in their early twenties, let alone his age.\n\"Rio is showing good things in every game in pre-season,\" said the Reds boss after the win against Yokohama F. Marinos, before quickly keeping his feet on the ground by adding: \"There was a moment where he should've squared it, so he can learn.\n\"But if you are 16 and you impact the game like he did, that's definitely a compliment.\"\nAfter his heroics in Newcastle, Jamie Carragher now believes Ngumoha \"has got to be involved\" in Liverpool's season - which will include a Premier League title defence and a bid to regain the Champions League trophy.\n\"It is difficult to create history at Liverpool because the club has got such great history. But there has been something about this lad in pre-season where Liverpool supporters are getting really excited,\" said Carragher on Monday Night Football.\n\"Luis Diaz has moved on and he was the competition for Cody Gakpo on the left. There is a feeling that Liverpool have to replace Luis Diaz but what do you do when you have a young player like this?\n\n\"That is definitely going to be in the minds of the Liverpool hierarchy in terms of what they do in the next week because when someone has an impact like that as a young player, that is not enough now.\n\"I am not talking about him playing every week but he has shown himself in a big moment, a high-pressure moment, composure at such a delicate stage of the game.\n\"You cannot not see him now on the bench and coming on in games for the next two or three months. He has got to be involved.\"\nLiverpool captain Van Dijk, meanwhile, has erred on the side of caution. \"I'm very, very pleased for Rio,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\"I've mentioned it before to him already, it's all a start now, he has to keep working hard and stay humble. He has to enjoy this, because these nights you can't take for granted, of course, if you're in his position.\n\"And I'm sure with the players that we have, he will be back in training and having a hard session tomorrow again.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Alexander Isak transfer news: Newcastle directors visit exiled forward amid ongoing stand-off over St James' Park future",
        "content": "Newcastle directors Jamie Reuben and Jacobo Solis visited Alexander Isak at his house yesterday ahead of the game with Liverpool.\nThe group held talks about the striker's future, which remains up in the air with less than a week of the transfer window remaining.\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said he wanted clarity on the situation in his post-match following the late home defeat to Liverpool.\nWhen asked about the talks by Sky Sports immediately after the 3-2 defeat, he said: \"I wasn't aware of it. Talks have been going on since Alex decided not to go on tour with us. I've concentrated on coaching the team so I've got no update for you.\"\nNewcastle chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan was present at the game but was not part of the talks with Isak at his house earlier in the day.\nNewcastle currently have six directors, including Al-Rumayyan who was at St James' Park on Monday evening.\nJacobo Solis is the head of public investments for Saudi PIF, the fund that owns Newcastle, and is the newest member of the club's board after being named a director last December. He previously worked as an investment banker in the USA. He is also involved in LIV Golf and the E1 power-boating series.\nJamie Reuben is the son of British billionaire investor David Reuben, and has been a co-owner of Newcastle since 2021. He was previously on the board of directors at QPR.\nSky Sports News reporter Keith Downie:\n\"The positive thinking Newcastle fans could read into this [meeting] that they are trying to come to some sort of agreement to re-integrate Alexander Isak into the first-team squad and be available to Eddie Howe going forward.\n\"I would suggest if he does remain a Newcastle player, he won't be available to play against Leeds this weekend either way.\n\"But the more pessimistic may think perhaps it's a meeting to work out the finality of the situations. But until we find out what happened within those four walls, all options are on the table.\n\"Isak would still like to move away from the club and it's dragged on for a long time now. It would be difficult to reintegrate into the squad given the strength of feeling of the supporters.\n\"Some of the things I heard last night at St James' Park and then we see the banners, I think it would be difficult to re-integrate - but if Liverpool don't come to the table with an acceptable offer, he will remain a Newcastle player.\n\"What has been the case for a number of weeks now is that Newcastle are getting desperate when it comes to replacements; they tried Ekitike, they tried Sesko, they missed out on Joao Pedro and Delap. They've tried and failed a number of times - and if they manage to get one in, or possibly two, there's a chance Isak may leave by the end of the transfer window.\"\nHowe revealed in his post-match press conference that he has not spoken to Isak for almost a week, and said his full focus had been on preparing his team for the Monday Night Football clash.\nThe Newcastle boss further admitted he would prefer to have Isak's situation sorted before the end of the transfer window, which closes at 11pm on September 1 - but is leaving the 25-year-old's future up to those above him at St James' Park.\nHe said: \"I've not been party to talks on this for a long time now. I've been concentrating on preparing the team and giving all my energy to the players who want to play for Newcastle, I think that's where it's best placed now.\n\"It would be ideal to have clarity and move forward, and change the narrative because it's the start of the season and we've got to get results and focus on what we can control.\n\"The quality of Alex would've made a difference in the two games, there's no denying that. But the team has functioned really well. That doesn't happen without every part of the team functioning well.\"\n\nNewcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes to Sky Sports:\n\"We always try to give our best, it's exactly what the message means. No one wins if the team loses. There's a lot of noise outside we can't control.\n\"I can't say anything, it's much bigger than me and I'm not in control of things going on outside. The focus is just to play for the club, make the fans proud and I think they left the stadium thinking that today. We lost but football is like that sometimes.\"\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Brentford are considering a move for Borussia Dortmund's Max Beier.\nThere has been no approach to Dortmund yet, though, and he is one several forward players Brentford are looking at.\nBrentford are in the market for someone who plays predominantly off the left-hand side to potentially replace Newcastle target Yoane Wissa . The Bees want a replacement secured before letting Wissa go.\nBeier can play anywhere across the front line but has mostly been a centre-forward at Dortmund. He is someone of long-term interest to Brentford, who tried to sign him last summer.\nThe 22-year-old Germany international signed for Dortmund instead and made 46 appearances last term, most of which were off the bench. He was also left on the bench for Dortmund's opening Bundesliga game against St Pauli.\nDortmund are getting closer to an agreement with Wolves for striker Fabio Silva and, if they sign him, it may limit Beier's game-time further.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Keith Andrews said he \"fully expects\" Wissa to still be a Brentford player after the summer transfer window closes.\nThe forward has not played for the Bees this season, as speculation around his future continues to swirl.\n\"It's very similar, stroke the exact same, as where we were pre-Villa,\" he said in a press conference on Monday afternoon ahead of playing Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports+.\n\"He won't be involved [vs Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup]. Again, it's just a decision based around what I feel is best for the group.\n\"The focus is on the group tomorrow. Yoane won't be involved. As far as I'm concerned, there's been no movement in any way and I fully expect Yoane to be here come next Tuesday.\"\nAsked if Wissa would be able to be reintegrated into the squad if he does not leave west London, Andrews added: \"That's the plan. If I didn't think it would be, my stance on it would probably be different.\n\"We've got a phenomenal group of players and staff that has been built over numerous years, where there's a real culture of togetherness, a real underpinning of respect throughout the building.\n\"People walk in and they feel that.

        "title": "Max Dowman: Arsenal midfielder, 15, being considered for England U19 squad after impressive Premier League debut",
        "content": "The FA's youth team coaches are considering promoting Max Dowman to England's U19 squad after his impressive Premier League debut for Arsenal against Leeds.\nThe 15-year-old has been capped 16 times at U17 level, scoring five international goals, and was a key member of England's U17 squad in the summer, starting each of their three European Championship games.\nNow - after winning a penalty against Leeds in Saturday's 5-0 victory for Arsenal - there is a possibility he will jump another age group, in recognition of his progress in senior football.\nBut for that to happen - because Dowman is still a minor - it will need the agreement of both his family and Arsenal. His development will be carefully managed - by club and country.\nHis team-mate Ethan Nwaneri - the only Arsenal player to make his Premier League debut at a younger age than Dowman - was promoted to England's U21 side in March, at the age of 17, after careful consideration of his readiness.\nNwaneri went on to be a key player for Lee Carsley's team as they retained their Euros crown in June, featuring in all six matches.\nThe feeling around Dowman, Sky Sports News has been told, is similar - in that many in the FA feel he is now ready to step up to the U19s, but more discussions will be held before any final decision is taken.\nGunners boss Mikel Arteta has no doubts about Dowman's pedigree, and his appetite for big games, saying after Saturday's match with Leeds: \"There is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that at 15 he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life.\n\"For us he brings joy, he brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.\"\nThe teenager has been involved with England's junior teams for several years, making his international debut for the U16s - and then the U17s - in 2024.\nHowever, the FA and Arsenal are mindful that he still has to take his GCSEs next spring and, because of his age, he cannot play Champions League football until January 1, 2026.\nDowman stood out in pre-season for Arsenal, coming off the bench on numerous occasions and impressing Arteta with the impact he made.\nThat prompted Arteta to bring him on at the Emirates on Saturday - albeit with his side already 4-0 up. In doing so, at 15 years and 234 days old, Dowman became the second youngest player to feature for Arsenal.\n\nDowman instantly excited the home crowd with a number of runs down the right wing and won the penalty in stoppage time that Viktor Gyokeres converted for 5-0.\n\"Ball carrying has been his super strength all the way through,\" former Arsenal academy coach Temisan Williams - now founder of Coach Accelerator Masterclass Community - told Sky Sports .\n\"I got to coach Max for the whole season when he was an U11s player and right from the get-go I was like: 'Okay, there's something very special about this young man'.\"\nDowman is now the most talked-about teenager in the Premier League. He's ticked off his first-team and then competitive debuts in a matter of weeks. All this sparks the question: How far can he go? And how quickly?\n\"Champions League, World Cup, Premier League,\" says Williams. \"He's got all the capabilities; he's got the mentality. Mikel Arteta wouldn't bring him into the fold at that age if he didn't.\"\nThere can be little doubt anymore - Max Dowman is Next Up .\nRead more on Max Dowman's development in the Arsenal academy here.\nThe Emirates Stadium crackled with anticipation every time the ball arrived at the feet of Dowman. As in Arsenal's pre-season games, his team-mates made a concerted effort to put it there. It is easy to understand why. The 15-year-old is a special talent.\nLeeds could not contain him. The drop of the shoulder to win Arsenal's late penalty capped a thrilling debut. On a day of theatre, of unveilings, injuries and first goals, it was Dowman, a schoolboy still four months shy of his 16th birthday, who stole the show.\nDowman might be Arsenal's most exciting academy product yet. He certainly looks uniquely ready for the step up at his age. But he is just the latest player off the club's production line in recent years.\nHale End continues to deliver.\nRead more about how Arsenal's academy has had a major impact on the Gunners' value here.",

        "content": "Brendan Rodgers called Celtic's demotion to the Europa League a \"huge blow\" for the club, following a 3-2 penalty shoot-out loss to Kairat Almaty.\nCeltic, who reached the Champions League knockout stages last season, drop into the second-tier competition after a goalless 210 minutes led to a nervy shoot-out in eastern Kazakhstan, where the game was staged 250 miles from the Chinese border.\nAdam Idah, Luke McCowan and Daizen Maeda all saw penalties saved by Kairat's 21-year-old second-choice goalkeeper Temirlan Anarbekov, as they became just the second Kazakh side to earn a place in the Champions League proper.\nRodgers told Amazon Prime : \"It's very frustrating. We showed a glimpse of what we can do at this level but we haven't been able to show that over the course of these two games.\n\"It's bitterly disappointing, because we were on the right track last season and working really well and playing really good football, so to not be in there this season is a huge blow for us. We missed a massive opportunity over these two games.\"\nMaeda blazed over from a glorious chance in the 86th minute before Celtic were denied on a series of occasions as they finally began to dominate in extra-time, but failed to convert.\nThe delay in crucial transfer activity has taken its latest damaging turn, with the club paying a hefty price after failing to replace Kyogo Furuhashi and Nicolas Kuhn this summer.\nCeltic have spent about £3million on transfers so far this summer, while bringing in around £20m - a sum similar to what they will miss out on following their failure to reach the Champions League proper.\nOnly two summer signings - Kieran Tierney and Benjamin Nygren - featured in Kazakhstan and the anticipated arrivals of Antwerp winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha and Boca Juniors left-back Marcelo Saracchi will come in the wake of fan anger.\nRodgers has been calling for attacking reinforcements since July, having missed out on a number of targets.\n\"We showed last year the strides I felt we took but you have to build on that,\" Rodgers added.\n\"The last thing you want to do in football is manufacture your own stress but all we can do now is look at where we're at as a football club and decide where we want to go.\n\"I thought overall it was a poor game. The pitch made it awful. We were defensively OK but couldn't quite make the breakthrough. We had good chances, especially in the second half and extra-time, and when it goes to penalties anything can happen.\n\"We just have to reflect on opportunities that we didn't take and we have to settle for the Europa League.\"\n\nFormer Celtic defender Mark Wilson speaking on Sky Sports News:\n\"It's tough to explain, there will be a lot of questions and fallout with a narrative of a lack of investment. There's a young right-back that finishes the game, a young centre-back, a centre-back at left-back.\n\"There are questions that need to be answered. Did the Celtic board gamble on the players that they've got to get them through?\n\"It's backfired dramatically and they pay the price. They've been poor over 210 minutes of football; created very little. Kairat were robust, made it difficult and they've got their reward. It's a real sobering moment for Celtic.\"\nAnalysis by Sky Sports' Laura Hunter:\nIt's hard to have much sympathy for Celtic and Brendan Rodgers after such a severe underperformance across two sets of woeful 90 minutes. They only have themselves to blame. And when the tie went to penalties, the sense of foreboding was overwhelming.\nKairat, a team in complete European obscurity until now, had more efforts on Celtic's goal on the night. For everything they lacked in quality, they made up in heart and spirit. They won more tackles, made more interceptions and completed more clearances. They won the duel count 75-63.\nThe Celtic board's unpopular decision to wait to do transfer business until Champions League qualification was secure has been rendered ridiculous. Rodgers will be rightly upset by that. But he still needs to inspire more from the players he does have.\nTo create so little against a team with so much less pedigree is inexcusable. His currency has got to be at its lowest since he rejoined the club back in 2023. Tough conversations ahead.",

        "title": "Liverpool a test of depth for Arsenal but Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke ease Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard worry",
        "content": "The last time Arsenal visited Anfield, for the 2-2 draw with Liverpool in May, Mikel Arteta only needed to glance over his shoulder for a reminder of their lack of depth.\nIn Kieran Tierney, Raheem Sterling, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Neto, Nathan Butler-Oyedeji and Jack Henry-Francis, six of the nine players seated on the Arsenal bench had played barely 1,000 minutes between them in the Premier League all season.\nFive of the six have subsequently gone. Zinchenko may well follow before the transfer deadline. All, though, appeared regularly in Arsenal's matchday squads last term, making up the numbers as injury problems exposed a shallow pool of trusted options.\nThree months on, the picture looks very different.\n\nInjuries that would have previously had fans writing off their chances at Anfield - to Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz - no longer feel disastrous, such is the squad's transformation.\nThe investment has been comprehensive.\nThe £67.5m arrival of Eberechi Eze took Arsenal's spending to £267m this summer. Eze is their seventh signing of the window after Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard, Noni Madueke, Cristhian Mosquera and Viktor Gyokeres.\nArteta's squad has been strengthened in all departments. But it is in attack that they hope to feel the benefits at Anfield on Sunday.\nArsenal may have to do without Saka, Havertz and Odegaard as well as long-term absentee Gabriel Jesus. But with Eze, Madueke and Gyokeres added to a pool of forwards that also includes Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Ethan Nwaneri and the emerging Max Dowman, they still have enviable options.\n\"They don't want to lose Havertz, they don't want to lose Saka, they don't want to lose Odegaard, but they have got better options behind them now,\" said Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville.\n\n\"That is what we need,\" added Arteta in his press conference after the 5-0 win over Leeds. \"I think the other way is not realistic to survive at the level we want for 10 months. None of the other top teams in the league do it, so why are we going to be different?\"\nTheir injuries throw up an early test of their increased depth, and their new signings are likely to play an important role in how they navigate it, with Gyokeres expected to lead the line at Anfield and Eze and Madueke providing new options in support.\nThe pair have added creativity, flair and ball-carrying ability, among other qualities. But they were signed for their versatility too. Madueke has already been used on both flanks by Arteta. Eze is of course comfortable centrally as well as out wide.\nEze's minutes were split between multiple positions at Crystal Palace but most of his best work came as a No 10. He therefore becomes an option to replace Odegaard, if he is unavailable, with Martin Zubimendi and Declan Rice ensuring defensive cover.\nMadueke could then take Saka's role on the right, which would allow some familiarity on the left. Martinelli was an unused substitute against Leeds but he tends to fare well against Liverpool, who have shown vulnerability on the break this season.\nArsenal have made a clear effort to increase their threat in those situations. Gyokeres, Madueke and Eze all excel at attacking space on transitions. But the same can be said of Martinelli, a player once described as \"a talent of the century\" by Jurgen Klopp.\nThe Brazil international has scored four goals in his last six appearances against the Reds, including the header which sparked Arsenal's comeback in the 2-2 draw in May.\nMartinelli was named player of the match for his display that day, making a season-high total of 41 off-the-ball runs as he repeatedly tried to exploit Liverpool's high line. But the cross for his goal was supplied by another player with a strong record against them.\nIn fact, Trossard is one of only three opposition players, along with Andrey Arshavin and Peter Ndlovu, to have scored a hat-trick in a Premier League game at Anfield following his treble for former club Brighton in a 3-3 draw there in January 2022.\nThe Belgium international will also be pushing for inclusion having looked bright off the bench against Leeds but Eze has inflicted damage from the left flank at Anfield too, scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory for Crystal Palace in April 2024.\nArteta could opt to install Eze on that side and, if Odegaard is unavailable, use Nwaneri in midfield.\nNwaneri was predominantly used on the right flank last season, deputising for Saka during his injury absence. But his first-half introduction for Odegaard against Leeds hinted at where his future lies. He performed well, completing all 26 of his passes.\nRepeating that feat in the cauldron of Anfield would be an altogether different challenge for Nwaneri but the 18-year-old provides his manager with another credible option.\nAlternatively, Arteta could call on Mikel Merino, who scored Arsenal's equaliser from midfield on their last visit to Anfield and might be better-equipped to deal with the physical demands of the game.\n\"I think he'll bring Merino in,\" added Neville. \"What he'll do is he'll make it a lot stronger, a lot more physical. That's what I would do and I think that's what Arteta will do. He'll go with one of his more powerful players in there.\"\nArsenal's injuries are of course far from ideal regardless of who steps into the team. Saka, in particular, has been vitally important in recent seasons, as Arsenal's record with and without him shows.\nTheir Premier League win rate drops significantly when the 23-year-old doesn't start, their scoring rate even more so.\nBut Arsenal's summer business has been geared towards precisely this, towards easing that dependence on individuals. Madueke provides a proven, high-calibre alternative in Saka's position. There is now flexibility across the front line, as in defence and midfield.\nIt could be argued that, in Gyokeres and Eze, only two of Arsenal's seven signings provide obvious upgrades to Arteta's starting line-up. But their depth of quality is transformed from last season.\nIt will be evident in the players seated over Arteta's shoulder at Anfield on Sunday as well as those on the pitch in front of him.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Rangers have accepted a bid from Lille for wantaway striker Hamza Igamane.\n\nIt is understood that the French club have met the £10.4m (€12m) release clause in his contract.\nIgamane has agreed terms on a five-year contract ahead of his medical, with the clubs finalising legal documents.\n\nSky Sports News revealed on Tuesday that the 22-year-old missed training ahead of Rangers' Champions League play-off clash against Club Brugge. However, it is understood he was not injured for the session.\n\nThat followed Sunday’s draw at St Mirren, where the player refused to come on as a substitute, claiming he was injured.\nLille had reopened talks with Ibrox chiefs this week, after an initial loan bid was rejected and are now set to sign the player.\nDutch side Feyenoord had also been keen on Igamane, who scored 16 times in his first season at Ibrox.\n\n\nSpeaking ahead of their Champions League play-off clash against Club Brugge, Martin said: \"I think I always just said to the players, you know, just be honest with yourself and with us as team-mates. I'd much rather that happen before the game than during it.\n\"It's happened, we moved forward, we dealt with it, he's got what he wanted. He looks likely to get what he wanted to play somewhere else and it means we've got a sum of money that we wanted for him.\n\"Ideally it wouldn't have happened but it did and now we've moved forward and we can move on.\"\nAsked if Igamane's scan revealed an injury issue, Martin said: \"I expect him to pass his medical.\"\n\nFollowing his former side's draw away to St Mirren, Sky Sports' Kris Boyd said:\n\"I think I said it a couple of weeks ago, I think the players have been running the club for far too long. Listen, if he's injured, he's injured. I highly doubt it.\n\"If that is the case, if I'm Rangers Football Club I'd drive him to the airport and say goodbye. If you've not got people who are willing to knuckle down and help this team at this moment of time, then see you later.\n\"If you don't there's a real danger. It's at boiling point right now with the fans. If Russell Martin is not strong, and doesn't see this through, he's going to join Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Michael Beale, Philippe Clement out the door.\n\"He needs to get the right type of characters in this dressing room and quick. I do question if Martin is a little too honest. After a game, emotions are still high and if you've turned to your bench for a striker that the fans think is the blue-eyed boy; I've not seen what everybody thinks.\n\"On a consistent basis, Hamza Igamane hasn't done what everyone thinks he's done for Rangers. He's another one who is inflated and everybody thinks is better than he is.\"",

        "title": "Premier League sides smash transfer record as spending passes £2.6bn but where is your club stronger or weaker?",
        "content": "Premier League clubs have set a new record for spending in a single transfer window this summer at over £2.6bn.\nArsenal's signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace saw the previous record fall with a week of the window still to go.\nBut how has the money been spent? Using net-spend figures, this week's Between the Lines looks at the positions in which clubs have strengthened this summer - and where they have got weaker.\nNearly half of the £2.6bn spent this summer has gone on forwards. At a whopping £1.4bn, Premier League clubs have splurged roughly £850m more on forward players than on players in any other position, with defenders next on £547m.\nThe figures highlight the huge value placed on attacking players, particularly in a summer when many of the Premier League's top clubs have been looking to add more firepower.\nThe most high-profile movers include Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Joao Pedro. But with the Alexander Isak saga rumbling on, the total could soar even higher before Monday's transfer deadline.\nNet spend, which factors money received in sales, adds another layer of insight and underlines the scale of the investment made by some of the Premier League's elite sides.\nManchester United sit top, having added Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha as well as Sesko for £207.5m combined. Marcus Rashford has left on loan to Barcelona, but they are yet to offset that spending by selling any of their existing options permanently.\nArsenal are not far behind them for net spend on forwards, with Eze following Noni Madueke and Gyokeres to the club at a combined cost of £180.5m before having made any sales.\nChelsea have also spent heavily, with Joao Pedro one of four attacking signings, but the sales of Madueke, Joao Felix and Armando Broja have helped reduce their net spend to £55m.\n\nWhile some clubs have bolstered their attacks, others have taken a hit - none more so than Crystal Palace , whose frontline is £67.5m lighter after Eze's move to Arsenal.\nMeanwhile, West Ham have made a net profit of £55m on forwards, having not yet replaced Mohammed Kudus, who joined Spurs for £55m, leaving them light in their front line.\nFurther investment may also be needed at Brighton , Brentford and Wolves, who are ostensibly weaker in attack, with negative net spends, having lost Joao Pedro, Cunha and Mbeumo, respectively.\nMoving on to midfield and, following the signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and no sales, Arsenal come out top for net spend on £66m as things stand.\nMuch of the focus is on Mikel Arteta's attack following their investment this summer but their midfield has also been significantly reinforced, with Zubimendi going straight into the starting line-up following his £51m arrival from Real Sociedad.\nEverton and Sunderland are next highest for net spend on midfielders. The Toffees have added Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Charly Alcaraz without losing anyone, while the promoted Black Cats have signed Enzo Le Fee, Granit Xhaka and Habib Diarra to offset the sale of Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund.\nManchester United are one of six clubs with a net spend of zero on midfielders, although that could change before the deadline, with Kobbie Mainoo's future uncertain and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville saying they need to strengthen the position as a priority.\n\nAlong with Chelsea , Aston Villa currently have a notable negative net spend on midfielders, owing to the £43m sale of Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle. The club are yet to replace the 24-year-old, or bring in any bodies in midfield, leaving Unai Emery with fewer options than last season.\nBournemouth stand out for net spend on defenders. Having lost three members of their first-choice back four last season in Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez for fees worth a combined £144.5m, they are in profit to the tune of £98m.\nReplacements have so far been recruited for lower costs, with centre-back Bafode Diakite joining from Lille for £35m and left-back Adrien Truffert arriving from Rennes for £14.4m. Their strong starts show there is value to be found in the market, as Bournemouth previously showed with Huijsen, Zabarnyi and Kerkez.\nAndoni Iraola will, however, need more backing defensively. They are still down a body at centre-back. But the club will aim to find the requisite quality while remaining in profit.\nIt may seem hard to believe on the back of their 5-1 thrashing by Chelsea, and their subsequent 3-2 loss to Wolves in the Carabao Cup, but the side to have strengthened their defence most, in terms of net spend, is West Ham , who have signed Jean-Clair Todibo following his loan spell for £35m and also added full-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.\n\nLiverpool currently have the second-highest net spend on defenders, with Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giovanni Leoni arriving after Real Madrid paid £10m for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Jarell Quansah left for Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.\nBut their figure could rise further if they add another centre-back, with Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi still a possibility.\nManchester City are the biggest net spenders on goalkeepers so far having re-signed James Trafford for £31m, and there could be more activity as there is uncertainty around the future of Ederson amid links with Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nBy selling Trafford to his boyhood club, Burnley are at the other end of the net spend on goalkeepers table, with Martin Dubravka and Max Weiss arriving for much lower fees, leaving them weakened in the position on paper.\nBetween the Lines , a weekly Sky Sports strand revealing the data behind football's biggest stories, put squad values under the microscope last week to rank and analyse the eight most valuable squads in the world.

        "title": "Man Utd 4-0 PSV: Elisabeth Terland scores hat-trick as Marc Skinner's side move closer to Champions League qualifcation",
        "content": "Elisabeth Terland's hat-trick propelled Manchester United one step forward in their Champions League qualifying campaign with a dominant 4-0 victory over PSV Eindhoven.\nThe Norway international scored in the seventh, 53rd and 63rd minute in Stockholm, where Celin Bizet-Donnum also added a first-half goal.\nUnited, who finished third in last season's Women's Super League, entered the competition in this second qualifying round semi-final, and will now take on the winner of Hammarby vs Metalist Kharkiv on Saturday.\nThe winners of that match enter the league path of the third qualifying round, while the losers will drop into UEFA's new Women's Europa Cup.\nUnited forced PSV into an early mistake from their high press, empowering Lisa Naalsund to tee up Terland for the opener.\nSummer signing Julia Zigiotti Olme then clipped a post from Terland's squared pass, and there were a pair of chances for Ella Toone before the Norwegian striker had the ball in the back of the net again, latterly ruled out for offside.\nIt was not long before United scored for a second time, orchestrated by Bizet-Donnum, who won the ball back before eventually working it to Toone via Anna Samberg's cross.\nThe England midfielder's initial shot was saved, but Bizet-Donnum was the fastest to react and lifted the ball beyond goalkeeper Moon Biegel Esteves in the 32nd minute.\nPSV started the second half strongly before Terland made it 3-0 after more loose defending from the Dutch outfit allowed Toone to intervene and slip a perfectly-weighted pass for the Norwegian striker to finish clinically.\nTerland then grabbed her hat-trick and put the contest out of reach with an excellent finish after playing a one-two with Toone before slotting the ball past Biegel Esteves.\nAnalysis by Sky Sports' Laura Hunter:\nQualifying for the Champions League proper has long been a Manchester United mission - and remains a necessary part of their evolution under Marc Skinner.\nThey feel as if they made decent strides last year but to continue to progress, attract top talent in the market, and mix it regularly with the WSL's best, they have to be competing in Europe's elite competition.\nThere will be some relief after overcoming a potential banana skin in PSV, who finished runners-up in the Dutch league last year. But in UEFA's elaborate qualification process, United still need to win on Saturday, and then enter a two-legged third qualifying-round tie in September.\nIf they do make it to the Champions League proper it will be well earned. And a significant breakthrough in the club's growing ambition to be viewed among the game's top-tier teams.",

        "content": "Newcastle are expected to make an improved offer worth £60m for Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nWolves rejected a second offer worth £55m from the Magpies after the 25-year-old scored two late goals to beat West Ham 3-2 to reach the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday.\nNo improved offer has gone in yet. The first offer of £50m was rejected on Monday.\nWolves manager Vitor Pereira admitted after the win against West Ham that \"every player has a price\" in the post-match press conference.\n\nHowever, Wolves' position is that he is not for sale in this window, especially with such little time to find a Premier League-ready replacement.\nWolves paid £23m for Strand Larsen earlier this summer, after his loan deal at Molineux became an obligation to buy, following certain playing criteria being met.\nNewcastle are in the market for a striker with the future of Alexander Isak still uncertain as Deadline Day approaches on September 1.\nNewcastle directors Jamie Reuben and Jacobo Solis visited Isak at his house on Monday before the 3-2 loss to Liverpool, the club heavily linked with the player, but Sky Sports News understands a resolution to the situation was not met.\nIsak informed the Magpies that he wanted to explore his options earlier in the window, with a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected on August 1.\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie :\n\"The player is open to move and while he is not agitating to leave, he is open to a move to Newcastle.\n\"Wolves want to make sure it is a fee they are acceptable with. Clearly, £55m is not enough. They are working in the background to sign a replacement to allow Strand Larsen to leave.\n\"If one or two dominoes fall, we might see a quick movement in the whole transfer market.\"\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett :\n\"A Premier League-ready replacement. That's the point.\n\"Jorgen Strand Larsen is a key part of the Wolves side, he's such an important player for them.\n\n\"They can't just buy a young player or take a risk on somebody from a European club who doesn't know the Premier League, and just throw him in there and expect him to do a job. It would leave a big hole in the Wolves squad.\n\"For Wolves to accept an offer for him at this stage, it has to be a big bid. And the big question is: is this new £60m bid - when it goes in - big enough to persuade them to sell?\n\"It would be a good level of profit for them. He was on loan at Celta Vigo last season and there was an obligation to buy him for £23m. They've just spent £23m on him and they could then sell him for £60m.\n\"That sounds like a good bit of business - until you start thinking about where they are going to get a replacement from.\"\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett :\nBorussia Dortmund have agreed a £22.8m (€26.5m) deal with Wolves for Fabio Silva.\nThe striker was flying to Germany for a medical on Wednesday. AC Milan and Roma were also interested, but the player prefers a move to the Bundesliga.\nSilva, 23, moved to Molineux from Porto for £35m in 2020 but has spent time on loan at PSV, Anderlecht, Rangers and Las Palmas after failing to secure a starting spot at the club.\nHe has made a total of 72 appearances for Wolves, scoring five goals and adding six assists.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Tottenham Hotspur's priority in the final days of the transfer window is signing a No 10 after missing out on key targets Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze.\nSpurs have registered an interest in RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons , Sky Sports News understands - however it is nothing more than that at this stage with Chelsea considered frontrunners for his signature.\nLucas Paqueta is admired but there is currently no indication West Ham would consider a sale.\nSimilarly, Morgan Rogers is another player of interest but Aston Villa consider him not for sale and there has been no movement, as things stand.\nGibbs-White was seen as the ideal player for head coach Thomas Frank - but Spurs insist they could not have done much more in what they felt was a bizarre few weeks with Nottingham Forest.\nEze joining Arsenal at the last-minute was a huge blow for a number of reasons and the information that has emerged since he signed has only reinforced why a few figures at Spurs were never totally convinced he was going to play for the club.\n\nSpurs maintain, as they did with Gibbs-White, that they did all they could to get a deal over the line. They felt they had an agreement in place with both Crystal Palace and the player.\nNico Paz is well-liked internally at Spurs but a deal for the Como attacking midfielder is considered a non-starter due to Real Madrid's financial interest in the player. They have a 50 per cent sell-on inserted in his contract and a buy-back clause worth £8.7m.\nLeft-wing is another position that Spurs are looking at before the window closes - and it is no secret that they want to sign Savinho .\nAs it stands, Man City do not want to sell and will only negotiate if they get a replacement and it is believed that target has been Rodrygo at Real Madrid .\n\nBringing in a defender is considered the third most important priority.\nFrank giving the green light to for Luka Vuskovic to join Hamburg on loan could be an indication that there is confidence at Spurs that a centre-back will come in. Ideally it would be a left-footed one.\nBayer Leverkusen centre-back Piero Hincapie had his admirers inside the club but is not a player they're considering amid interest from Arsenal . With Frank often switching to a back three, a late move for a senior defender remains possible.\n\nOne of the early plus points for Frank's reign has been the midfield. Joao Palhinha has been outstanding since arriving from Bayern Munich on loan and its clear Spurs were crying out for a tough tackling midfielder last season.\nThe midfield trio he formed with Rodrigo Bentancur and Pape Sarr - arguably the most impressive player under Frank thus far - played a key role in Saturday's impressive win at Manchester City.\nSpurs are now looking to further bolster their new coach's options, particularly in attacking and creative areas, as Frank looks to build on a promising start to life in north London and prepares for a demanding Champions League campaign.",

        "title": "Russell Martin: Rangers boss retains board support as Kris Boyd questions keeping him in charge at Ibrox",
        "content": "Russell Martin will take charge of Rangers against Celtic after the Ibrox board backed the under-fire head coach after their humiliating thrashing by Club Brugge.\nSky Sports News understands his position is not under consideration ahead of Sunday's Old Firm clash at Ibrox - live on Sky Sports.\nFans in the away end in Belgium were heard calling for him to depart the club after just 84 days in charge.\n\nThe club's Fan Advisory Board have since called for Martin to be replaced, irrespective of Sunday's result against Celtic.\nRangers have won just three of their 10 matches under Martin, who has made the worst start as a permanent Rangers manager.\nThe Ibrox side have drawn all three Scottish Premiership matches, and a defeat on Sunday would leave them nine points adrift of their rivals.\nIt is believed the US ownership group, including chairman Andrew Cavenagh, were already planning to attend the Old Firm match.\nThe result across the two legs is the joint-third biggest margin in Champions League history and also extends his record to just three wins from 10 games at Ibrox - the worst of any manager in the club's history. Yet Martin, who watched as the remaining away supporters called for his sacking at full-time, has no fear of any immediate repercussions.\n\"I have nothing to say but really apologise to the fans that travelled and the fans back home,\" Martin told TNT Sports post-match.\n\"The job of head coach and manager is to make sure it doesn't happen again and respond properly. We didn't respond well enough to an early setback tonight. It shouldn't happen, it's such basics. Now we have to show a big response on Sunday.\n\"Patrick [Stewart] and Kevin [Thelwell], I've had a chat with them already, they're amazingly supportive. They knew this would take time, they understand the club's position.\"\nMartin would also go on to continue his rhetoric about a lack of commitment from certain players, a sentiment he also ushered following the 1-1 draw with St Mirren that saw Hamza Igamane allegedly refuse to come off the bench.\n\"There's not enough harmony or care for each other quite yet. But I knew that coming in, we have to build that, heal and get stronger through it,\" he said.\n\"There aren't enough players who want to fight for each other and the club yet. The window shuts on Monday. The harmony has been disrupted.\n\"I'm not talking about individual players, I'm talking about the group as a whole. The harmony of us. It's not an excuse, we need to be much better.\n\"For us, it really hurts, it's really humiliating tonight and we have to make sure we respond in the right way on Sunday.\"\nThe Rangers Fan Advisory Board have called on the Ibrox club to replace Martin.\nIn a statement, they said, \"irrespective of the result on Sunday, it is clear to us the manager should be replaced as a matter of urgency before our justified anger gives way to apathy\".\nThey added \"the board must commit to a new manager who understands and accepts the standards that have been set by our successful teams in the past - and can deliver on them\".\nIn November 2023, Rangers announced the establishment of the Fan Advisory Board and confirmed they would meet \"at regular intervals with senior club management\".\nRangers' statement at the time added that the Fan Advisory Board would \"play a crucial role in shaping the future of Rangers FC, providing vital input and guidance on key club matters and policies\".\n\nSky Sports' Kris Boyd following his former side's 6-0 defeat to Club Brugge:\n\"There will be an investigation into this. So bad, so, so bad. It looks like a group that has absolutely chucked it.\n\"Inside just weeks of a new manager coming in, it's worrying.\n\"I know a few people said - myself included - that Russell Martin wouldn't lose his job off the back of a Champions League defeat. Because there's no disgrace in losing to Club Brugge.\n\"But the way Rangers have lost - there will be a lot of Rangers fans wanting Russell Martin removed.\n\"I don't disagree [that he needs more time]. That's football - but it's totally different in Glasgow. If you're losing 9-1 to a team in the Champions League, it's bad enough.\n\"You can say you're going to be given time - with new owners coming in that's what they will look to do. But you have to see signs of improvement and that's not been the case.\n\"The reality is: you have two huge football clubs domestically, but when they go to Europe, they are shown up for what they are. Both are obsessed with winning domestically.\n\"Celtic had more success than Rangers in recent times. but Celtic have their own issues - their fans are not happy with the board not spending money.\n\"But domestically they will be fine. You wouldn't rule out Celtic winning another treble with the way this Rangers team are. Rangers will be hoping another team - a Hibernian, Hearts or Aberdeen - putting up a fight to stop Celtic winning a cup, because Rangers ain't going to do anything the way things are now.\n\"It is getting worse. That is really impossible to happen inside six or seven weeks into a new season. But Rangers have found a way.\n\"You speak about performances that could get managers the sack - this is heading in that direction. I will struggle to see a way back for Russell Martin after this.\"\nRangers captain James Tavernier refused to outright back Martin when speaking with TNT Sports after the final whistle, but did admit that he and his teammates had to take responsibility for their poor start to the season.\n\"For what we want to do as a team and as a club, we didn't represent the club in any good shape or form there.\n\"We had aspirations to get into the Champions League. We're in the Europa League now but it's still early in the season. But we have to make sure this is the last night or the last game that we feel like this will put in a performance like that.\n\"Myself and the senior boys have had a good chat in the dressing room. We all have to hold our hands up and be responsible.\n\"The gaffer gives us a game plan. But you look at the goals that we conceded. We all have to be responsible individually and collectively.\n\"We can't concede easy goals like that. We have to showcase and prove to the manager and to the fans that we belong on the pitch. We didn't do that tonight.\"\nThe Rangers Fan Advisory Board (FAB) has called on the Ibrox club to replace Martin .\nIn a statement, the FAB said: \"Irrespective of the result on Sunday, it is clear to us the manager should be replaced as a matter of urgency before our justified anger gives way to apathy.\n\"The board must commit to a new manager who understands and accepts the standards that have been set by our successful teams in the past - and can deliver on them\".\nIn November 2023, Rangers announced the establishment of the FAB and confirmed they would meet \"at regular intervals with senior club management\".\nRangers' statement at the time added that the FAB would \"play a crucial role in shaping the future of Rangers FC, providing vital input and guidance on key club matters and policies\".",

        "title": "Ruben Amorim's Man Utd crisis after Grimsby Town defeat: What next after miserable start to the new season?",
        "content": "A new low? Quite possibly. Defeat to fourth-tier opposition for the first time in the club's long and storied history, to use a Ruben Amorim phrase, speaks loudly. Manchester United are at another crisis point just three winless games into the new season.\nThose at the top had hoped the nadir was behind them. Omar Berrada, United's chief executive, had said as much. \"As of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us.\" He had praised the \"very clear identity\" of Amorim, talked of a long-term vision.\nSir Jim Ratcliffe had proclaimed that the Portuguese was doing \"a great job\" in March and complained that everyone was expecting miracles. United supporters would settle for avoiding humiliation at Grimsby. The FA Cup is the only hope now. And this is August.\n\nThere will be plenty persuaded by the argument that Amorim needs more time, that part of the problem at United over the dozen years of discontent since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure is that the club has been unable to stick to a plan, to see an idea through.\nThere is logic to that thinking, particularly when the club has committed to this course enough to be dispensing with homegrown talents who do not fit Amorim's system. What sense in reshaping formation and club only to abandon the project so swiftly?\nThe last vestiges of the previous regime are only just being swept away. Remember that image of Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho perched on the hoardings? The poster boys of the FA Cup victory last year on the periphery now.\nThe dangers of flitting from one idea to the next are oft-discussed. Marcus Rashford might be the best or worst placed to comment depending on your view but he articulated the issue well in a recent interview. \"You end up in no-man's land,\" he said.\nThe awkward issue for United's decision-makers is that the argument for continuity only makes sense if the man in whom this faith is placed still believes. The most worrying aspect of events at Blundell Park was the behaviour of the coach upon whom this rests.\n\nThere was the sight of him shuffling his tactics board with his team two down to Grimsby. There was the spectacle of him steering clear of his own players before the penalty shoot-out and then being slumped in the dugout refusing to watch once it began.\nThe memes are one thing but more significant were the words that followed. \"Something has to change,\" said Amorim in the aftermath of defeat. \"And you are not going to change 22 players again.\" This from a coach who has offered to leave before.\n\"I have nothing to say. That is the biggest problem.\" Indeed. Because there has been enough change of personnel on the pitch for Amorim to be beginning to take control of this situation by now. He finished the game with his new £200m forward trio out there.\nBut Matheus Cunha was the first Manchester United player to miss, Bryan Mbeumo was the last. In between, there was the strange sight of Benjamin Sesko, the club's new £74m striker, being the very last outfield player out on the pitch to step up to take one.\nBoth Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu, the latter as a specialist wing-back designed to fit his system, have come in since Amorim's appointment. Manuel Ugarte has worked with him before. More players are needed but it should be functioning better than this.\n\nThe tactical inflexibility that saw Mason Mount deployed at left wing-back will be the focus of a lot of noise externally. But internally, the chief concern of both Amorim and those above him will be that the much-vaunted spirit and harmony has dissipated.\nThat was the message of the summer coming out of the club, that there had been a change of mood to go with the new stadium plans and training-ground revamp. Luke Shaw spoke of the toxic environment of the past. This was a fresh start at United.\n\"Now, I am excited,\" Amorim told Sky Sports just recently.\n\"It is completely different.\"\nThe fragility of that has already been exposed. It survived defeat to Arsenal on the opening weekend because there were some positive signs, but a stuttering draw at Fulham was less convincing and this performance was as miserable as it gets.\n\nAlready, the optimism has been undermined and United finding themselves lurching once more. Just hoping they can navigate a home fixture against Burnley, limp to that international break and take stock once the summer transfer window has closed.\nTime. That is at the heart of this. \"We have a game at the weekend, then we have two weeks and we will solve things.\" But that was what pre-season, Amorim's first, was supposed to do. Manchester City and Chelsea will be waiting for them on their return.\nAnd yet, still there is an appetite for all this to work, for a talented young coach who has lost more games than he has won at Manchester United to come good in the end, for an exciting new team to emerge stronger from this chastening experience.\nThose at the top are certainly invested. The men who saw themselves as part of the clean-up operation risk being seen as adding to the mess.

        "title": "Jess Carter: Man arrested in relation to racist and abusive messages sent to England defender during Euro 2025",
        "content": "A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of malicious communications in relation to some of the racist and abusive messages sent to England international Jess Carter during Euro 2025.\nThe 27-year-old defender revealed during the tournament in Switzerland that she had been subject to racist slurs on her social media accounts since the tournament began.\nThe FA contacted UK police when it was informed of the abuse Carter has been subjected to, and the un-named man from Great Harwood in Lancashire has since been apprehended. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.\nAn investigation was launched by the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) after Carter revealed the scale of the abuse following England's quarter-final win over Sweden.\nCheshire Constabulary chief constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chief Council (NPCC) lead for football policing, said: \"The messages directed towards Jess Carter were appalling and I would like to commend her for standing up to this abuse and assisting with our investigation.\n\"Nobody should be subjected to such disgusting abuse, and I expect that today's arrest will be the first of many over the coming months.\n\"We want to make it clear that racist abuse of this nature will not be tolerated. Everyone is responsible for what they do and say, and we want to ensure offenders cannot hide behind a social media profile to post vile comments.\"\nAt the time of Carter's public statement, tributes poured in from far and wide including from her Lionesses team-mates and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nResearch from SentientSports GuardianAI went on to find that Carter had been the player targeted with the most negativity on social media during the penalty shoot-out win over Sweden, with 9.8 per cent of abusive posts aimed at her.\nOn the back of the abuse, the Lionesses collectively decided to stop taking a knee ahead of matches during the tournament.\nIn her initial statement on July 21, Carter said: \"From the start of the tournament I have experienced a lot of racial abuse. Whilst I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don't agree or think it's ok to target someone's appearance or race.\n\"As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.\n\"As ever I am grateful for all of the support from the genuine fans but I am taking this measure to protect myself in a bid to keep my focus on helping the team anyway I can. Hopefully speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so that others won't have to deal with it.\n\"We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all. I'm now looking forward and focusing on putting all of my energy into helping my team.\"\nEngland went on to lift the Euro 2025 trophy in Switzerland, with Carter starting and playing the whole game of the final penalty shoot-out win over Spain.",

        "title": "Dominik Szoboszlai indispensable to Arne Slot at Liverpool, Graham Potter's big issue at West Ham - The Radar",
        "content": "\nWelcome to The Radar , a Sky Sports column in which Nick Wright uses a blend of data and opinion to shed light on need-to-know stories from up and down the Premier League. This week:\n🔴 Szoboszlai's importance to Slot ⚒️ West Ham's sluggish midfield 💯 Haaland's Man City milestone 🔍 A player to watch this weekend\nDominik Szoboszlai was the only Liverpool player not to touch the ball in the build-up to their winning goal against Newcastle but he still made the most important contribution.\n\n\"That, for me, should go down as an assist,\" said Thierry Henry on Monday Night Football of the dummy that allowed Mohamed Salah's cut-back to run through to the unmarked Rio Ngumoha.\nIt was typical of Szoboszlai in its selflessness. The 24-year-old had been pushed into midfield by that point in the game but he had spent the rest of it at right-back, called into action in a position in which he had never previously played a competitive fixture.\nIt was a daunting assignment in the cauldron of St James' Park, up against the pace of Harvey Barnes. But the Newcastle winger was substituted in the second half having been nullified, not registering a shot or even completing a dribble up against Szoboszlai.\n\"He was absolutely outstanding in this game,\" said Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher. Liverpool are likely to have Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez available again against Arsenal on Sunday but Slot now knows he has another option. Szoboszlai continues to show his worth.\nFlorian Wirtz's arrival has increased the competition in Liverpool's midfield but Szoboszlai's versatility and tactical intelligence make him uniquely important. It is not unusual to see him adjusting to different roles within games, adapting to what is required.\nJurgen Klopp described him as \"a joy to work with\" and Slot feels the same way. \"In my opinion, he is a bit underrated, but not by me,\" said the Liverpool boss last season. Slot, like Klopp before him, values his tireless work rate as well as his technical and tactical qualities.\nIt is not just the work he gets through but the manner in which he does it. \"He just keeps on running with the highest intensity,\" added Slot. Szoboszlai is in a league of his own on that front among Liverpool players. According to GeniusIQ , he ranks behind only Anthony Gordon and Dominic Solanke in the Premier League for sprinting pressures since the start of last season.\nIf there is one criticism of Szoboszlai, it is that he could contribute more in terms of end product. But he deserved an assist for Liverpool's winner on Monday, as Henry said, and the value of his unseen work out of possession cannot be underestimated.\n\"That is so important for a team that wants to compete for something,\" added Slot. Szoboszlai will continue to play a vital role.\nNottingham Forest's game against West Ham on Sunday is a meeting of two managers under pressure for different reasons. While politics threaten Nuno Espirito Santo's position, results and performances are the problem for Graham Potter.\n\nLast Friday's 5-1 thrashing by Chelsea felt like a nadir after the 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland on the opening weekend. But the situation went from bad to worse as tensions boiled over during Tuesday's Carabao Cup exit against Wolves.\nPotter now takes his side to the City Ground having won fewer points than his predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, in the same number of games. Only Avram Grant has averaged fewer points per game among West Ham managers in the Premier League era.\nThe numbers are damning but Potter has not been helped by the club's sluggishness in addressing long-standing issues in terms of personnel. A midfield inhibited by a glaring lack of pace continues to be bypassed by opponents all too easily.\nJames Ward-Prowse, Tomas Soucek and Guido Rodriguez, their midfield starters at Molineux, actually rank as some of the Premier League's most industrious players for distance covered. The problem is that they sit at the opposite end of the scale for speed.\nIt is remarkable that a Premier League side's slowest players should be concentrated in central midfield and it is only now, in the final days of the window, that the club are addressing the problem.\nThe incoming Matheus Fernandes will instantly become one of West Ham's quickest players having recorded a top speed of 35.12 km/h for Southampton last season. Soungouto Magassa is also seen as someone who can bring some speed across the ground.\nBut West Ham's lack of pace is not limited to their midfield. Mohammed Kudus and Michail Antonio, two of their quickest attackers, have now departed, with the 33-year-old Callum Wilson, signed on a free transfer, the only attacking recruit so far.\nThe squad's shortcomings were apparent long before this summer. The club's recruitment is rightly under scrutiny. But their under-fire manager must get more out of what he has got too.\nErling Haaland is in line for his 100th Premier League appearance when Manchester City face Brighton on Sunday. Pep Guardiola will hope to see him back among the goals after drawing a blank against Spurs but he will reach the milestone with a record total regardless.\nHis tally of 87 goals from 99 appearances puts him comfortably ahead of any other player in Premier League history at the same point and underlines why so many sides have sought to add their own versions in this summer's transfer window.\nFor Arsenal, Viktor Gyokeres is the chosen one, another low-touch No 9 to add the killer instinct they lacked. Liverpool want Alexander Isak having already added Hugo Ekitike. Manchester United and Newcastle, meanwhile, have targeted strikers with similar physical profiles to Haaland in Benjamin Sesko and Nick Woltemade. So too, in fact, have Brighton, in Greek youngster Charalampos Kostoulas.\nHaaland has brought the No 9 back into fashion.\nOn a packed Super Sunday , Brighton vs Manchester City , Nottingham Forest vs West Ham, Liverpool vs Arsenal and Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace are all available to watch on Sky Sports .\nBryan Mbeumo had a night to forget against Grimsby in midweek but his running power was the focus of last week's column. Matt O'Riley also featured as he fills the Joao Pedro role for Brighton.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Manchester United's attitude stinks and Ruben Amorim could walk if they don't beat Burnley, Paul Merson says",
        "content": "Manchester United are arguably at their lowest ebb after an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town.\nRuben Amorim's side were very much second-best against their fourth-tier opponents, falling 2-0 down at half-time. And while Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire rescued a 2-2 draw, they then crashed out after a marathon penalty shoot-out.\nAfter the game Amorim made some concerning comments, insisting his players \"spoke really loud to him\" and that \"something has to change\" - but adding he cannot change 22 players again.\n\nSo what now for Man Utd? Sky Sports' Paul Merson gives his verdict on their plight. Read the Magic Man's comments below...\nI watched the whole game and all the way through to the penalties and: hard work. You have to put in the hard work. You could be some of the most talented players in the world but you have to work hard.\nNo disrespect to Grimsby, they shouldn't be on the same pitch as Man Utd. If Man Utd turn up with the attitude Grimsby had, there's only one result and everyone would have been turning over at half-time, looking for something else to watch. That wasn't the case.\nHalf of them turned up thinking: 'I'm only playing because it's Grimsby. I won't be playing against Burnley on Saturday'. Instead of: 'When I walk off that game, those Grimsby fans and players will go: I didn't know he was that good.' That's not the case.\nThe attitude stinks from half of them. Back in the day, there were shocks, the pitches were a joke. That pitch was immaculate and they should go out and destroy Grimsby.\nCristiano Ronaldo doesn't get to the top by just his talent. And if he has to work hard as one of the greatest players of all-time, why can't the Manchester United players? It's arrogance.\nWho can knock on the door this weekend and go: why am I not playing? And they all want to leave! Where are they going to go? Who's going to take them?\n\nWhen he said: my players talk really loud - that means he has seen enough to know that they're not really playing for him, in my opinion.\nThen he turned around and said 'I can't change all 22 players', [meaning] 'it will have to be me to leave'.\nI was a manager at Walsall. You just know, and you get a feeling, when things aren't right.\nWhen Amorim came in everybody knew he could play three at the back. Everybody knew. Man Utd knew. The owners knew.\nHe got that job by going the way he played. They never had the players to play that way - ever.\nI could have seen him go in at Chelsea with Malo Gusto, Reece James - attacking wing-backs who can make things happen and cross the ball. They're up and down. Chelsea have three centre-backs who would have suited the way he played.\nThey got the wrong man for the players they had. He had to change the whole lot. They're not going to do that and he's not going to change his system for Man Utd.\nHe came in from Portugal to one of the biggest jobs in world football playing the way he played. Why would he change?\nHe didn't want to come in during the middle of the season because he knew they were not his players. No wing-backs. Then he had to come in, it was a mad struggle and this season he hasn't got it.\nAmorim has probably just gone: 'I just have to outscore teams', with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko up front. Bruno Fernandes playing as well. And I don't think he'll do that.\n\nI will be shocked if he's still in charge if Man Utd don't beat Burnley. But they will beat Burnley! It's a nice game.\nErik ten Hag had that as well: three or four games without a win and then second-bottom of the league came. They just won that game and then lost three or four games again.\nIt's just going to keep on covering the cracks. They will be called Pollyfilla United!\nI don't think Amorim will be shy to go: 'I've had enough. I can't do anything. I've done what I can'.\nI don't think he is one to put himself through pain to get his pay-off. I don't know the man, but [the way he is] coming across, I think he's an honest man and will be honest with himself. But I think they will beat Burnley.\n\nFor me, I would have said yes. You don't win league titles, World Cups or European Championships without good goalkeepers.\nOnana doesn't save points, the goalkeepers lose points at Man Utd. So as soon as you lose points, that's a worry.\nThey need a new goalkeeper. I see Gianluigi Donnarumma's around - why don't they go for him? But again, they've used their money in other positions.\nThey need legs in midfield. No one has ever won a tournament or league without legs in midfield.\n\nThey bought Sesko for £70m and he's taking the 10th penalty? I thought he had a broken leg when he stepped up. I thought he must be that injured that he's taking the 10th penalty.\nAnd then I heard people saying that he didn't want to miss or take that pressure. He's a £70m player! He's coming to score goals for Man Utd to take them back to where they should belong and he's taking the 10th penalty?\nHe has to be in the top five. He's taking a penalty from 12 yards and the goalkeeper can't come off his line!\nI forgot that he was playing and then when he stepped up for the 10th penalty... wow.",

This was a snapshot of hope, an image to believe better times were ahead.\nHojlund was in the hot streak of his Man Utd career, in the midst of a run which saw him bag seven goals in six games.\nGarnacho recorded his best figures for goal involvements that season, scoring seven in the Premier League - including that Puskás winner at Everton - and the opener in the FA Cup final win over Man City.\nMainoo also netted at Wembley, seemingly confirming his rise would inevitably take him to the top.\nSitting down with then-United boss Erik ten Hag in the days after the Old Trafford photo was taken, the Dutchman sounded a warning to the trio.\nHe spoke of having to match \"high potentials\" with high performances. \"They are the next steps, which have to come,\" he told Sky Sports .\nBut unquestionably the feeling at that point was optimism. \"We have some exciting players,\" said Ten Hag, when he was asked about the celebration. There was a smile from a manager who is typically more interested in tactical talk than emotions.\nHe could see the importance of the symbolism and also what it meant to Man Utd supporters.\nAfter all, this is a club which prides itself on its history of developing and honing young talents.\nYet, fast forward to the final days of this summer's transfer window and Hojlund is off to Napoli, Garnacho to Chelsea and Mainoo - that prized, homegrown asset - can't get in the first team, has requested a loan and is expected to be the subject of offers from elsewhere.\nMainoo and Garnacho, in particular, feel victims of circumstance - and Ruben Amorim's fixation on 3-4-3.\n\nThe Englishman isn't trusted in the central midfield two - despite playing a similar role alongside Declan Rice at the Euros. Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte are favoured there.\nHe got a runout in the disastrous defeat to Grimsby but it is clear Amorim isn't convinced he has the attributes for the position.\nA short-lived experiment to play Mainoo off the striker seems over too, with United spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With Fernandes also deployed in that more advanced role, Mainoo, again, could count him fourth-choice in another position.\n\nGarnacho, meanwhile, finds himself a winger for a team which no longer uses them - and a wing-back role never looked like a conversion to maximise his talents.\nThere have been strops at substitutions and friction off the field but attitude is not a core reason for his exit.\nFor Hojlund, too many misses have ultimately been his undoing, with Benjamin Sesko now signed to lead the line. However, he could justifiably point to a far from fully-functioning attack around him.\nAnd there should also be sympathy for a young forward who was never intended to carry the weight of being United's lead striker, having arrived in a summer when they intended to also go for Harry Kane.\nInterestingly, Hojlund had more goals than Kane when he turned 22 but United want to move on.\nIt is not hard to imagine this trio following Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Antony in rejuvenating their careers away from Old Trafford.\nThey are all talented and will surely enjoy good times again. And that will raise more questions about the environment and culture at United - and perhaps, down the line, regrets.\nWhere, for instance, will Mainoo be in a couple of years time, when Fernandes, Casemiro and Ugarte will likely have departed?\nWould Amorim's successor - whether he arrives sooner or later - not wish to have a winger with Garnacho's threat?\nThe pair could be jettisoned in favour of the ideas of a head coach with the worst Man Utd managerial record in the modern era.\nIt has been the story of United since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement: veering from one direction to another with little thought of the long-term plan.\nHojlund, Garnacho and Mainoo looked set to be the future when they were pictured together on that promising day at Old Trafford. Just 16 months on they are out of the frame.",

        "title": "Eberechi Eze: Can Arsenal's new No 10 help end the Gunners' long wait for a Premier League title?",
        "content": "Eberechi Eze's journey to becoming an Arsenal player was one that began with the tears of a 13-year-old and one that culminated in an on-pitch unveiling at the Emirates.\nFor a sum of £67.5m, Arsenal signed a player they let go from their academy over a decade ago. When he found out he would be released by Arsenal as a youngster, Eze recalls having to train while crying throughout the session as his dream of representing the Gunners was crushed.\nHaving sat down with Eze in May, after his FA Cup heroics clinched Crystal Palace's first major honour, it was clear that faith and a family-borne resilience kept him going.\nIt wasn't the only setback a young Eze had to face. Fulham, Reading, and Millwall also overlooked him, unable to unlock and foresee the talents of the now England international as the 27-year-old was forced to take the long way home.\n\nQueens Park Rangers offered Eze an opportunity, before Crystal Palace took a punt on one of the Championship's finest and provided a stage in the top flight.\nAnd now, after etching his name into folklore at Selhurst Park, the Emirates finally awaits as the redemption arc nears realisation in Arsenal's new-look attack.\nPalace's unlikely yet historic FA Cup triumph confirmed what fans of the club already believed - Eze could be relied upon to lead the club to great things.\nEze himself knew that it would happen. For him, it was only a matter of timing.\n\nOn the day of Palace's trophy parade, he sat with the same confidence he takes to the pitch.\nWhen Eze signed for the club from QPR, he walked into a dressing room that had the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke.\nAll three, in their own right, contribute to a team capable of surviving in the Premier League. Becoming Palace's marquee man formed the basis of any overarching ambition Eze had, but it had to begin with humbly learning from his elders. It was those role models who Eze paid homage to as the foundation of Palace's current success.\n\nThe groundwork was laid for a new Palace player to spearhead the side as they all moved onto pastures new, and it was a mantle Eze picked up with both hands.\nWith Premier League survival continuing to be the Palace's primary goal under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira, Eze initially struggled for consistency, with injuries providing an obstacle.\nHowever, the FA Cup proved to be Eze's coming of age. He spurred Palace on, scoring in both the semi-final and final. The back end to the 2024/25 season saw Eze perform at his very best, displaying a consistency that will have impressed Mikel Arteta and Arsenal.\n\nWhat made Eze a joy to watch was the unpredictability he brought to SE25. It's that x-factor Arsenal have perhaps lacked, coming up short in their attempts to fend off the competition for the Premier League title.\nArsenal have been said to have developed an overreliance on Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, who have proved dependable sources of goals and assists. This is reflected heavily on the pitch with Arsenal's biasing the right-hand side during attacks.\nWhile various patterns born out of this area have unravelled defences and produced key attacks, an obvious foil for opposition defences is to gamble and double up in that area of the pitch.\nAware of this, Arsenal have negotiated means of ensuring Saka remains a threat; however, the predictability in attack means Arteta's free-flowing attacking side of perhaps a couple of seasons ago has become a team commended for their strong foundations, but at times failing to excite in attack.\nAs one of the league's chief creators from his favoured left-hand side, Eze adds a new dynamic to Arsenal attacks. Should Eze fill in on the left, which many have predicted, he'll become another vessel for Arsenal attacks, creating a balance that could unnerve the staunchest of defences.\nIt's also important to note, though, that at Palace, Eze was seldom used as a traditional touchline winger. In Glasner's system, he was what's best described as a 'left 10' when in possession. As a left 10, Eze offers Arsenal what they don't have in any of their current options off the left.\nIn attack, Eze's athleticism, along with his desire to get and stay on the ball and operate primarily in the half space, frees up further opportunities for a left-back to maraud forward to create overloads. But his distinct confidence on the ball means beating players one-on-one is also an option.\nDefensively, the discipline of Glasner's 3-4-2-1 will have readied Eze for the demands of Arteta's fluid 4-3-3. As with his Austrian counterpart, a willingness to take up defensive positions off the ball, cover space and support your full-back are among Arteta's non-negotiables. Eze fits that bill too, as one of last season's leading attacking players when it came to winning the ball back in the defensive and middle third of the pitch.\nThe redemption story to this point appears far too perfect for Eze's story to close with simply signing a deal at Arsenal. Rejection was just the beginning with Eze deliberately navigating himself back to where he felt he belonged.\nHe said he'd do \"anything possible to win the Premier League\" back in May. The FA Cup win just whetted his appetite for more.\nThe Emirates is primed and ready for Arsenal's new No 10. But whether he will be the difference maker in Arteta's long-awaited hunt for a league title remains to be seen.",

All was fine. Trained fine yesterday [Saturday], warmed up fine. I turned around to him at 60 minutes because I wanted two strikers on the pitch. Hamza told me he was injured.\"\n\nTwo days later, the Morocco international was missing from training - despite scans showing there was no injury - as Rangers prepared for their Champions League play-off second leg away to Club Brugge.\n\nHours later on Tuesday, Rangers confirmed they had accepted a bid from Lille after Igamane's release clause was met.\nMartin said Igamane \"got what he wanted\" before adding: \"Ideally it wouldn't have happened but it did and now we've moved forward and we can move on.\n\"It's not the players' fault, it's really not.\n\n\"It's really difficult for a young man, a young man that doesn't speak the language, that's being told, 'Don't worry, your future is going to be elsewhere' and then I'm asking him to be all in and do this and 'this is what we need from you' and all that stuff. So difficult, so I don't take it personally.\"\nIgamane has signed a five-year deal at the French club, departing Ibrox just one year on from his move from AS FAR.\nGirona striker Bojan Miovski is undergoing a medical ahead of his £4.2m move to Rangers.\nOnce completed, the North Macedonia international is due head to Glasgow to finalise the paperwork on a four-year contract.\nSky Sports News revealed on Thursday that the clubs had agreed an initial fee of £2.6m, with £1.6m in add-ons.\nThe move will see the former Aberdeen player return to Scotland just one year on from his £6.8m switch to Spain.\nHe scored 44 goals in 98 games for the Dons, but struggled in LaLiga, netting just four times in 23 appearances.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports",

That is not going to change.\n\"The players not playing with be disappointed but everyone will have opportunities. You have to fight in the week.\"\nAsked about the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who is nearing a move to Napoli on an initial loan deal, Amorim said: \"Until it is official, I cannot say much.\"",

I now can't be influenced or swayed by outside noise.\n\"Also, when you grow up and have to experience many tough things you realise a bit of perspective and gratitude that means actually, this is football.\n\"It means so much for everyone, but there's a lot of tougher things to endure. Now we have to make sure that we win as many games as we can.\"\nRangers have won three of their 10 matches under Martin, who has made the worst start as a permanent manager at the club.\nHis side have drawn all three Scottish Premiership matches, and a defeat on Sunday would leave them nine points adrift of their rivals.\nAsked if Sunday's game against Celtic had extra significance given Rangers' start to the season, he added: \"This game is always going to be important for anyone.\n\"The manner of defeat makes everything feel terrible. We've qualified for Europa League, we have a chance to put things right on Sunday.\n\"I think the noise is the loudest I've ever had to deal with as a coach or a player, but you have to accept that being here and I knew it was going to be the case.\n\"That is what it is. It doesn't affect the work. We have to be really driven and focused on Sunday now and it's really as simple as that.\"\n\nMartin has insisted there has not been a breakdown in his relationship with Nico Raskin, amid speculation he could leave the club before Monday's transfer deadline.\nThe Belgium international did not start against Club Brugge but has trained ahead of Sunday's game.\n\"Everyone's here, everyone's available, and the squad and the team will be picked on what we think is the best way to win the game,\" the former Southampton boss added.\n\"Nico is in training today.\n\"The whole squad is here, things can change, transfer window's open, so I can't tell you anyone's going to definitely be in the squad or not.\nAsked if there has been a breakdown in his relationship with Raskin, he added: \"I'd describe my relationship with all the players, all the staff as honest, open. I don't think you can have anything else apart from that,\"\n\"There's not a breakdown in any relationships here. If it's honest and open, there can't be a breakdown in any relationships.\"",

However, if there's an opportunity there where a deal suits all parties and there's something that can come in that I'm happy with then of course, we have to look at it.\n\"Yang's been a really good squad player for us over the last couple of years and sometimes the challenge for someone who probably maybe sees themselves as a squad player is that, after a couple of years, they then feel that need and want to move on.\n\"I totally understand that and I think the situation with Yang, that's been ongoing for a while now.\n\"However, because of where we're at within the squad, then there was no way that we could let Yang go. I know that if he stays here, Yang, he plays a really important contribution for us in the squad throughout all the games that we'll play.\"\n\nCeltic are set to confirm the signing of Uruguayan left-back Marcelo Saracchi from Boca Juniors after the 27-year-old trained at Lennoxtown ahead of Sunday's Old Firm game, live on Sky Sports .\nBelgian winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha, whose transfer from Royal Antwerp was announced by Celtic on Thursday, also trained and the 24-year-old could make his debut against Rangers.\nThe additions come after the Hoops lost to Kairat Almaty on penalties in their Champions League play-off, and Rodgers is keen for Celtic to avoid that situation again.\n\"The club's so well run, with the board, with Dermot, it's been that way for many years. Obviously we sell players, we make a lot of money, but we also put money in as well. So the investment's there,\" the Irishman added.\n\"The big thing we need to look at is the timing of investment.\n\"I always think that's really important because that's something I felt that we could have had, maybe, leading into the game, then it would certainly give us a better possibility.\n\"But it hasn't happened and we need to understand why that is, and what the sources of that are, that can help us be better in the future as a football club. That's my take on it.\"",

        "title": "Bukayo Saka's hamstring injuries a big concern, says Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta",
        "content": "Mikel Arteta has admitted Bukayo Saka's hamstring injuries are a big concern as Arsenal prepare to face champions Liverpool without their talisman on Super Sunday .\nSaka, who missed a three-month period of last season due to an injury to his right hamstring, was forced off after feeling something in his left hamstring during Arsenal's 5-0 win over Leeds.\nThe 23-year-old has avoided the need for surgery on this occasion, with the injury not as bad as first feared, but he will play no part at Anfield and has also been omitted from the England squad.\n\"Bukayo is doing better but he is out for a few weeks unfortunately,\" said Arteta at his press conference on Friday.\n\"No surgery. It's not as bad as the previous one. Obviously it's very unfortunate to pick it up but it's on the other side.\n\"It's an action that requires full power from him. He felt something, so he will be out for a couple of weeks.\n\"Let's see how he evolves in the next few days and weeks, repeat the scan and see where he's at.\"\nAsked if Saka's second hamstring injury in under a year was a big concern, Arteta said: \"Yes it is a big one, especially when we talk about a sprinter, a player who gets into that zone very often, who needs that burst, that change of pace to be threatening.\n\n\"We will learn again why it happened and make him stronger, but unfortunately injuries are part of your career.\n\"He hasn't had that many, with the amount of games he has played, but it's something we want to eradicate.\"\nSaka was not the only player forced off against Leeds, with captain Martin Odegaard having to be withdrawn after landing awkwardly on his shoulder.\nOdegaard has, though, been called up for Norway's upcoming games and Arteta said he is pushing hard to be fit against Liverpool.\n\"We don't know yet. He hasn't trained yet and if he does it will be tomorrow. Let's see.\n\"He is doing everything he can. We are doing everything we can to make him available. But we have to wait and see tomorrow.\n\"There is an injury there but hopefully, if everything goes well, he can cope with it.\"\nOne player who will definitely join Saka on the sidelines against Liverpool is Kai Havertz , who has had to undergo surgery to fix a knee injury which the club hope will only keep him out for weeks rather than months.\n\"Very unfortunate, very sad for him,\" said Arteta. \"I think he did tremendously well to recover from the previous one. He had never had an injury before.\n\"And then this happens. But it's part of football. We need to live with that. Obviously we lose another big player for many, many weeks but [surgery] was the right thing to do.\n\"The doctors advised it and he was very convinced at the end that it was the quickest and best way to resolve the issue.\"\nArsenal's injuries open the door for new signing Eberechi Eze to make his debut at Anfield.\nThe forward was unveiled at the Emirates Stadium ahead of the game against Leeds and has already made a positive impression on Arteta in training.\n\n\"Really impressed with him. I heard a lot of things about him, I spoke to a lot of people about him. Really bright, a very special energy and a special aura around him.\n\"He's already gathering a lot of information, the things we want to see on the pitch, but especially [we have to] make sure he has the freedom and capacity to express his quality, which is the reason why we brought him here.\"\n\nAsked what specific qualities he will add to his team, Arteta said: \"First of all his energy. When you are next to him, you are comfortable. He has got a big smile, he asks you the right questions.\n\"And then his flow with the ball, the ability to pick passes, to drive past people effortlessly, and just understand the timing of things. Very impressive.\"\nArsenal will head to Anfield on Sunday aiming for a first Premier League win at the ground since 2012 and Arteta has challenged his players to seize their chance to make a statement about their title credentials.\n\"They are the champions for a reason, because they deserved to be champions,\" he said of Liverpool.\n\"They were the better team last season, the most consistent one, the one that found ways to win in many different ways.\n\"We want to be that team this year and we need to go to Anfield with that spirit and that conviction.\n\n\"You want to continue building the momentum we are in right now. Going to those grounds, against this kind of opposition, is what you want. Coming from those big games winning in a really convincing way, that's the objective.\n\"The favourite is always the one that won in the previous year. Someone has to come and take that crown away from them, and that's what we, the rest, are going to try to do.\n\"We have already started with the first two games in the Premier League, and that's the aim, be better than them.\"\nArsenal will be without long-term absentee Gabriel Jesus in addition to Saka and Havertz, while Christian Norgaard and Ben White are being monitored along with Odegaard.\nIn a separate interview with Sky Sports News , Arteta said he is delighted with Arsenal's summer transfer business so far and added that sporting director Andrea Berta has done a \"fantastic job\" during the window.\nThe Gunners made their seventh signing of the summer when they confirmed the £67.5m arrival of Eze from Crystal Palace and are now in talks over a deal to add Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie.\n\"Very happy,\" Arteta told Sky Sports News . \"A lot has happened during the summer. Obviously, we were losing some big players as well. A few players were still injured for a long time.\n\"So, I really liked what we've done. The type of characters, personalities we have recruited, the way we have increased the quality and the depth of the squad at the same time, and the way especially they have connected and collaborated with the team.\n\"I think it was [a time to refresh]. I think as well the demands that we are putting on those players, the standards, and the demands that we have now as a football club, as a team.\n\"So, we required this and, as I said, we acted. The club was very aggressive, very determined. Andrea has done a fantastic job there with his team and I'm very, very glad with the outcome.\"",

        "content": "Tottenham have completed the signing of Chelsea target Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £51m.\nThe 22-year-old had been of interest to Chelsea all summer, but Spurs swiftly moved ahead of their London rivals to complete a deal for Simons.\n\"Noise? Don't listen to it all, only what matters. Tottenham called and I answered,\" Simons said in his announcement video, seemingly in reference to links to Chelsea.\n\n\nSky Sports News understands the Netherlands international has signed an initial five-year deal plus two optional years\nSimons is expected to be presented to the Spurs fans ahead of Saturday's Premier League home game against Bournemouth.\nChelsea decided not to bid for Simons due to having other targets, as they look to complete a £40m deal for Alejandro Garnacho , while their valuation of Simons was £43.3m (€50m) to £47.6m (€55m).\n\nSimons' arrival at Tottenham ends their hunt for a new 'No 10', having frustratingly missed out on previous targets.\n\nSpurs failed in their pursuit of Nottingham Forest captain Morgan Gibbs-White earlier this summer, before north London rivals Arsenal hijacked their move for Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze .\nThe capture of the versatile Simons, though, will be of great relief to boss Thomas Frank, who lost James Maddison to a serious knee injury at the start of August, which will sideline the England international for the majority of this season.\nSimons, who had also been of interest to Bayern Munich, becomes Spurs' seventh summer signing to take their spending past £170m.\nSky Sports News understands signing a left-winger is still a target for Spurs in the final days of the window.\nSimons revealed how talks with boss Thomas Frank were key in his move.\nHe told the club's official website: \"I'm really happy and can't wait to get going. I've been dreaming of this for a long time.\n\"It's a great club and when I met the head coach I knew straight away that this was the right place for me.\n\"I will bring flair to the team, but also hard work and discipline. I want to do everything I can to win, for the team and also for the fans.\"\nSimons will wear ex-captain Heung-Min Son's No 7 shirt at Spurs after the forward left the club this summer to join LAFC.\n\"The year at PSV, (7) was the number that I had,\" Simons said. \"I had a really good season as well and the national team I’m number seven as well, so for me this was the best option.\n“He [Son] made his own story with this number. I think he deserves it as well. The way people treat him in the club, not only in the club but the fans as well, they love him. Everyone loves Son.\n“Hopefully I can make my own story with it. I know it’s a big responsibility, but I’m ready to take it and ready to make my own story!\"\n\nA product of Barcelona’s La Masia academy, Simons moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 2019 as a teenager before he made headlines during a productive loan spell at PSV in the 2022/23 campaign.\nSimons would spend the next two seasons at Leipzig, scoring 22 goals in 78 appearances before his move was made permanent earlier this year.\nFrank said: \"I’m really pleased we have brought Xavi in - he is a great addition to the squad.\n\"He is still young, however, he already has good experience and, over the past few years, has played a lot of games at the top level.\n\"Xavi has proven his ability to get goals and assists, both from the No 10 position and left-wing. He also has a great eye for his team-mates in terms of unlocking defences, and I know he will come in and be part of a good team that is already working hard together.”\nSimons moving to Tottenham represents an exciting addition to the Premier League. This is a player long regarded as one of the top young talents in Europe – and he showed glimpses of that ability despite it being a more difficult season for RB Leipzig.\nThere are those top-line numbers. Ten goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga, even as Leipzig missed out on Europe for the first time since their elevation to the top division. He ranked in the top 10 for goals from open play and big chances created.\nBut it was another statistic, the fact that Simons also ranked among the top 10 players for possession won in the final third, that really cuts to the heart of what can make him so good.\nIt is why Simons remains so attractive. Thomas Frank and Tottenham have been eyeing a No 10 all summer, pursuing Morgan Gibbs-White even before James Maddison suffered a serious injury. They have energy in midfield but combining that with craft is the key.\nThere are some gifted players around, individuals able to provide that spark, but finding those capable of doing the work out of possession, playing at high intensity, is difficult. They are at a premium. Simons has demonstrated that ability from the outset.\nRead Adam Bate's feature on Spurs' new signing here.\n\n\n\n\n",

After a season, he moved to Bundesliga club RB Leipzig but only made 27 appearances in three years before being loaned to Turkish side Galatasaray during the 2020/21 season.\nThe left-back joined Levante in Spain before heading back to South America with Boca Juniors.\nSaracchi told Celtic TV : \"I'm delighted to be here. I've met all the boys and my overriding emotion is just of excitement and I can't wait to get started.\n\"I've known for a little while that I was coming so there's a lot of excitement there and I can't wait to get started, get out and get playing, and I'm looking forward to it.\n\"I remember the fans at Celtic Park. They were amazing and the stadium had a great atmosphere.\n\"The pressure of playing for a big club is something that I thrive on. It doesn't hinder me, it's the opposite. I look forward to it and I think it pushes me to be better.\"\n\nSouth American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News:\n\"He's a stocky little left-back, very, very quick. When he first came through, I had immense hopes for this player, real hopes.\n\"I thought he was the future of Uruguay at left-back, and I thought he was on for a brilliant career. So far, it's proved a little bit of a disappointment.\n\"He's been through Germany without doing a great deal, Turkey a little bit more, a little bit in Spain, and then back to Argentina. So he's bounced around.\n\"I think what he perhaps needs in his career is a bit of stability.\n\"As an attacking left-back, I think there's plenty that Celtic can get out of him, especially because he's clearly in a league where Celtic are going to be on the front foot for the vast majority of the time.\n\"So hopefully, this can be the move where Saracchi finally unlocks that potential that I saw a few years ago, but hasn't really come out so far.\"\nKieran Tierney's return to Parkhead was the first confirmed summer transfer, after the defender agreed a pre-contract with his boyhood club.\nMeanwhile, goalkeeper Ross Doohan is also back at the Hoops on a three-year deal after leaving Aberdeen.\nCeltic then added Benjamin Nygren from FC Nordsjaelland in a deal worth around £2m, with the winger signing a five-year deal.\nDefender Hayato Inamura has joined from Albirex Niigata , while Shin Yamada has moved from J-League side Kawasaki Frontale - both on four-year deals.\nJahmai Simpson-Pusey agreed a season-long loan from Manchester City, with the club also securing the signing of teenage forward Callum Osmand on a free from Fulham.\nMichel-Ange Balikwisha became the eighth addition, joining from Royal Antwerp for £5m on a five-year deal.",

They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.\nKobbie Mainoo has requested a loan move to get more game time this season, Sky Sports News has been told.\nBut United have no intention of allowing him to go on loan and Ruben Amorim insisted on Friday that he wants the 20-year-old to stay.\nAmorim said: \"I want Kobbie to stay and he needs to fight for his place.

        "content": "Chelsea are set to beat other Premier League clubs to the loan signing of Facundo Buonanotte from Brighton.\nThe Blues are close to completing the season-long loan signing of the 20-year-old in a deal that does not include an option or an obligation to buy.\n\nThere was interest in Buonanotte from other Premier League clubs, including Leeds United.\n\nBrighton have insisted they only want to loan the Argentina international to a club in England.\nBorussia Dortmund had made a loan offer for the player with an option, while there was also interest from French outfit Lyon.\n\nBuonanotte would be the latest Brighton player - or member of staff - to make the move to Chelsea since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's takeover at Stamford Bridge in 2022.\nBuonanotte would be reunited with former Seagulls team-mates Marc Cucurella, Robert Sanchez, Moises Caicedo and Joao Pedro at Stamford Bridge.\nThe club have also taken a string of staff members, including former boss Graham Potter and recruitment specialists Kyle McAuley, who has since joined Potter at West Ham, and Sam Jewell and Paul Winstanley.\nIncluding the cost of Potter's appointment, Chelsea have spent more than £287m on bringing players and staff in from Brighton, with chief executive Paul Barber joking at the club's fans' forum recently that Chelsea are his \"best customers\".\nChelsea's pursuit of Buonanotte follows an attempt to sign Julio Enciso by Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg, although that move appears to have stalled due to an injury to the Paraguay international.\nBuonanotte has scored five goals in 50 games for Brighton since his arrival from Rosario Central in 2023. He spent last season on loan at Leicester, where he scored six goals in 35 appearances.\nHe can play on the right flank or at No 10 and would become Chelsea's ninth signing of the summer transfer window.",

        "title": "Unai Emery interview: Aston Villa head coach on trying to compete with the richest clubs and why he will do it his way",
        "content": "Perspective is needed at Aston Villa after defeat to Brentford followed a goalless draw at home to Newcastle. It means Villa have failed to score in their first two games for the first time in over 20 years. They are the only one of the 92 clubs yet to score.\nVilla supporters have been left frustrated by a summer in which spending has been restricted and Jacob Ramsey, one of their own, has left for Newcastle. Amadou Onana has now joined Boubacar Kamara on the injury list for Sunday's game against Crystal Palace.\nEmery shares that frustration, of course, describing the club's start as \"poor\" but there is plenty of pride too. Villa's unbeaten Premier League home record now extends over a year. Only last season's top three have picked up more points since he came in.\nThat remains astonishing. Not just because of the circumstances of his arrival, with Villa looking lost and languishing near the bottom at the time, but because seven of the starting line-up on the opening weekend, including the entire back four, were here already.\nThe club is transformed. That context is important. \"Before we arrived, they were struggling, they were even in the Championship,\" Emery tells Sky Sports . \"And now, everything happened. Everything we are sharing with them. It has been fantastic.\"\nHe begins to list just some of the achievements. \"I am very excited to play in Europe again. The Europa League is a fantastic opportunity for us.\" That probably goes without saying when Emery has already lifted that particular trophy on four different occasions.\n\"We played in a semi-final last year in the FA Cup and we played in a semi-final two years ago in the Conference League.\" He might have mentioned the small matter of a Champions League quarter-final too, edged out 5-4 on aggregate by Paris Saint-Germain.\nBut is it getting more difficult? That is a question being asked by supporters. They are asking that question of their club, of the Premier League, and of UEFA. Fans want to feel like they are always building towards something. The appetite for progress is constant.\nIncredibly, after a season in which Palace, Newcastle and Tottenham ended long waits for a trophy, Villa are the only club with an average attendance over 40,000 in last season's Premier League not to have won silverware since 2023. Their own wait dates back to 1996.\nEmery himself posed the question in his programme notes ahead of the big kick-off against Newcastle. Referring to the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR), he wrote of 'clubs doing good management, who will never be allowed to dream'.\nAsking him about that and the challenges facing Villa, he is happy to explain. Typically, however, his first thoughts are tactical rather than financial. It is not just that his team needs strengthening, it is that the Premier League continually poses new problems.\nVilla had 76 per cent of the possession away to Brentford but still could not score. The need to find new solutions is evident if they are to continue to outperform the budget and compete with those clubs at the top end of the Premier League table.\n\"For two years, we have competed for the same positions and gone to Europe. The top seven teams are aware of how we are performing and they want to beat us as well. And it is becoming more difficult for us to try to surprise them. Now it is not surprising.\n\"We are facing them and we are playing well and we are getting good results in the league. But of course, the Premier League is very difficult. And there are other teams as well that are trying to get to the same position that we achieved in the last few years.\n\"Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Fulham. There are others as well. Everton and West Ham, they can be close to us as well to be getting a European position, a top 10 position. The Premier League is a challenge for everybody - for clubs, players and coaches.\"\nBehind the scenes at Villa, one suspects there are those who feel it would be fairer if their accomplishments were judged in comparison to these clubs rather than the free-spending heavyweights that Emery has helped to establish Villa alongside at the top.\n\"The most important teams in the Premier League,\" he begins, before reeling the names off. \"They are really spending a lot of money to increase the level of their squad with more big players.\" The inference one takes is that Aston Villa are not in that position.\nWhile Villa's wage bill is significant, they actually have a negative net spend on transfer fees since the winter of Emery's first full season in charge. For context, while their apparent rivals take up the top seven spots on the list, Villa are 84th out of the 92 clubs.\nHow can they grow, how can they continue to compete, in such circumstances? Emery is defiant. \"We have our own way,\" he says.\n\"We have our own way and we are happy.\"\nEven so, a few more players, UEFA wage restrictions permitting, would surely help bolster what is the smallest squad in the Premier League. Emery spoke in his press conference on Friday of involving the academy players but he would like another solution.\n\"We need to add some players in the attacking third,\" he tells Sky Sports . Evann Guessand has come in at least. The flexible forward from Nice is currently adjusting to Emery's specific tactical demands but is expected to be a useful addition to the squad.\n\"He is going to help us in attacking third,\" says Emery of the 24-year-old Ivorian. \"He is versatile. He can play wide. He can play a little bit close to the striker and even as a striker. I think his versatility is very important. He is going to be an important player for us.\"\nThe final hours of the transfer window before Monday's deadline are expected to be busy. \"Maybe I will spend the day here until the last moment,\" he suggests. In truth, it is the only way that he knows. \"My response is to try to work. To work, to work, to work.\"\nHe adds: \"I am very, very motivated. I believe in the players, I believe in how we are, how we are building the team. Being intelligent and being competitive, this is the way we were doing it. And this is the way as well that we have to do it. This is the challenge.\"\nWatch Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace on Super Sunday; kick-off 7pm",

        "title": "Nick Woltemade joins Newcastle: Stuttgart striker signs in club-record £69m deal to increase chances of Alexander Isak exit",
        "content": "Newcastle have signed Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade in a club-record deal of £69m which opens the door for Liverpool to make a British-record bid for Alexander Isak.\nThe Magpies have agreed to pay £64.86m (€75m) plus £4.3m (€5m) in add-ons for the Stuttgart forward, taking the total package just north of £69m and surpassing the £63m they paid for Isak three years ago.\nWoltemade's arrival increases the likelihood of Isak leaving for Liverpool with less than three days left of the transfer window.\nNewcastle have maintained that Isak would only be sold if an adequate replacement was found. However, they will attempt to bring in a second striker before listening to offers from Liverpool.\nLiverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid for Isak rejected earlier in the summer so will have to increase their offer to reach an agreement with Newcastle. Isak is adamant he will not play for his current club again and is yet to feature this season.\nNewcastle have landed Woltemade ahead of Bayern Munich, who had multiple offers rejected for the forward this summer after he scored 17 goals in 33 appearances for Stuttgart.\nWoltemade says Newcastle have \"big plans\" for him.\n\"I'm really happy to be at this amazing club. From the first contact, I felt like the club really wanted me and had big plans for me,\" he said.\n\"It's a big step in my life to leave Germany but everybody has welcomed me so well and it already feels like family. I have a really good feeling from speaking to the head coach that this is the right place for me to find my best level.\n\"I know the stadium from watching games on television - it looks amazing and I know the atmosphere is crazy. I'm really excited to play and start scoring goals here.\"\nAnalysis from Sky Sports' Adam Bate:\nIt was only a matter of days ago that Germany was abuzz with talk of Nick Woltemade making a move to Bayern Munich . On a recent visit to Stuttgart for the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup against the Bundesliga champions, it was Woltemade - not Harry Kane or Luiz Diaz - who was in the spotlight.\nSpeaking to a host of legendary Bundesliga figures about the 23-year-old forward on that trip, the word that kept coming up was 'unconventional'. Woltemade is 6ft 6in tall but is not a typical target man, preferring to roam into wide areas and drop deep.\nHe is even a dribbler, capable of beating opponents with his surprisingly nifty footwork. Cacau, the Brazilian-born Germany international whose goals fired Stuttgart to the Bundesliga title in 2006-07, was particularly fulsome in his praise for Woltemade and his importance to the team.\n\"He is an amazing player,\" Cacau told Sky Sports . \"He can score goals but he can also give assists. And he is a perfect player for Stuttgart, the perfect No 9. He plays very unconventionally because he is tall but he is also technical. Very, very good.\"\nIt is apparent that Newcastle are looking for a physical No 9 who is capable of leading the line. They have wingers who can provide service for such a player. But they want someone who can bring those wingers into play too. Woltemade fits the bill.\n\nBoth Newcastle boss Eddie Howe and Liverpool head coach Arne Slot were asked about Isak and a potential switch for the striker in their pre-match press conferences on Friday.\nAsked if Isak would stay at Newcastle, Howe said: \"It's difficult for me to give you any clarity. I don't know what the future holds in that respect because I'm not dealing with it myself.\n\"I've got no update from what I spoke about the other day. I'm concentrating on trying to bring players to the club.\"\nSlot was equally coy, saying: \"If it's true, Newcastle have signed a new No 9 and that's very nice for Eddie because Anthony Gordon is suspended and Isak has not been training.\n\"As always, we try to sign players who can help us. There's no reason, after the first two games, to complain, to think we need more. But if we can strengthen the squad, we will try to do that if it's for the right money and the right player.\n\"Let's see if we do something and if we can, what we can do.\"\nNewcastle are still trying to sign Yoane Wissa , who has not played for Brentford in the current campaign amid the Magpies' interest. Newcastle have had two bids turned down by the Bees for the striker.\nHowever, Howe's side are unlikely to continue pursuing Jorgen Strand Larsen given his similarities to the 6ft 6in Woltemade. Newcastle also had two offers rejected for the Wolves striker.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Premier League predictions and best bets: Trends to point to draw in Liverpool vs Arsenal",
        "content": "Our football betting expert Jones Knows is back to offer his predictions and insight across the Premier League, tipping a 5/1 double.\nThe market is completely overlooking a new strand of Erling Haaland that might be about to explode. His headed goals numbers.\nOf his 87 Premier League strikes, 15 of them have been headers anyway but that metric is going to be on the increase based on City's new stylistic approach in the final third. It was clear from the outset of the game against Wolves that the inclusion of Tijjani Reijnders has added a directness to what City now do.\nCity weren't turning back inside looking for options, they were looking to hit Haaland inside the area with early crosses.\nHaaland is 6ft 4in remember, and built like an Olympic discus thrower - he is suited to this style. He's recorded five headed shots in his two games this season and a headed goal is on the way. Timing is everything so jumping on now at 9/2 with Sky Bet for Haaland to score a header could be a wise move.\nThe matchday before the first international break always hits hard.\nJust as the season is gathering momentum, we're hit with the prospect of England vs Andorra again. Sigh.\nAn interesting betting angle developing in this final matchday before an international break is that the goal average goes up when analysing it against the season average.\nIn the last six seasons on the matchday before the first international break, the goals per game average is at 3.3, from a sample size of 60 games. If you compare that figure to the average goals per game across those six seasons in the Premier League, which is at 2.8, we're seeing 0.5 more goals scored per game in this matchday. A huge difference in a low-scoring sport like football.\nThat makes the over 2.5 goals line of interest here at Evens with Sky Bet. Having watched West Ham in all three of their matches so far this season, Forest could clear this line on their own. The Hammers have conceded 11 goals and there doesn't seem to be any signs of Graham Potter going back to basics to address the clear problem.\nAsk yourself this: would Arne Slot and Mikel Arteta take a draw right now? The answer is yes, isn't it? Categorically.\nThat makes the draw a huge runner from a betting point of view.\nIt's very unusual to have a fixture played before Gameweek four involving two title rivals. Looking at the past trends when looking at this type of fixture played early on in the season, draws are very common.\nThe last five fixtures in the Premier League before Gameweek four to be played between teams that finished that season in the top three all ended in stalemates - the most recent of which was Arsenal's 2-2 with Manchester City last season.\nThe draw here is the bet at 23/10 with Sky Bet. It's the bet of the weekend.\nIf you need some evidence of why Oliver Glasner is such an incredible manager, just look at his record against Unai Emery, who is arguably regarded as the best pound-for-pound manager in Europe.\nGlasner has won four of the last five meetings with Emery with the aggregate score reading a hefty 17-4 in favour of the Austrian.\nEmery just hasn't found a way of breaking down Palace's mid-to-low block and Glasner's tactic of utilising Ismaila Sarr's pace and power has been so dangerous.\nSarr has been phenomenal in these fixtures, registering seven goal involvements in his last three appearances against Villa. That included two goals and an assist in the 3-0 FA Cup semi-final win. He is 2/1 with Sky Bet to either score or assist again.",

Marc is a crucial part.\n\"Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.\n\"He shows in every game that he's focused. If Marc had said 'I want to leave Crystal Palace', it would already have happened weeks ago.\n\"Marc is fully committed to the team, he shows it every third day at the moment... it is my point of view that we need to keep Marc.\"",

United did create 3.54 worth of expected goals from 26 shots as they did put Burnley under significant pressure.\nIn midweek, Amorim fuelled speculation over his future saying \"something had to change\" after their embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby, before later adding he \"sometimes wants to quit - and sometimes wants to stay at Man Utd for the next 20 years\".\nSpeaking after their win over Burnley, he said: \"When they [his players] put the effort, I will always love them.\n\n\"Even when Amad is missing that goal - I love Amad, if he's giving everything.\n\"We need to understand that we always need to be at this level of effort. Because even in the game, we played well in the beginning. I think we struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match is not so perfect and you can feel the players struggle a little bit, even in the second half but the effort was always there.\n\"We tried to put people in the box. We tried to put more people inside the box, not just around the box to play the ball. Some of the things we were doing during the week and spoke about they were doing that and were focused on the game. So that is the most important thing.\"\nAmorim says his side need both Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha to be competitive after admitting his concerns over their respective injuries.\nCunha went straight down the tunnel, midway through the first half, appearing to clutch his hamstring. Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.\nAsked for an injury update, Amorim said: \"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.\"\nUnited goalkeeper Altay Bayindir conceded two goals from Burnley's six shots at goal and was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal after spilling a shot following a long throw-in.\nAndre Onana was at fault for both Grimsby goals in midweek, allowing Charles Vernam's 22nd-minute strike to go through him at his near post before missing his punch at a cross which gave Tyrell Warren a tap-in eight minutes later.\nAmorim has admitted it's difficult to be a Manchester United goalkeeper such is the scrutiny on the club.\n\n\"They are humans. At Manchester United everything is the news. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper and you can see even when I change the goalkeeper these situations happen. We are in that moment. It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.\n\"If you look at the goal, we can defend better the box. We suffered a similar goal against Fulham because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.\n\"These things don't have anything to do with the goalkeeper. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. Players are struggling a little bit with all the things that are happening around the club, that is normal. It's not just the goalkeepers; everybody has to improve.\"\nRuben Amorim speaking to Sky Sports:\n\"Is it really important? In the future, we are going to find out.\n\"These three points, I think, if you look at the game, we should solve the game right in the first half and then control the game. But it's never easy.\n\"We have to try to fight until the last minute, things that we overcomplicate. But for me, the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what happens, we try. During the game, we try in every moment, sometimes playing well, sometimes playing too open, too fast, losing possessions.\n\"But the effort was there.\n\"I think if you look at the first half, we have so many chances to score a goal and then that can help us to control the emotions, the game, to involve the fans.\n\"But we are always doing this and then you have the feeling you can control the game and I think you control it well. But then one throw-in, one set-piece in this moment is really hard for us. But I was shaking my head because sometimes things are really easy.\n\"I don't like to see penalties, but I like to see the image of the fans. But I was just thinking sometimes one moment can change a lot of things.\n\"But in that moment I just was thinking that it's fair to win this game. I was not expecting Bruno to miss two penalties in a row. So I was really confident.\"\nAmorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing Benjamin Sesko returned to the substitutes' bench.\nSesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby, also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.\n\"So he finished the game (against Grimsby) with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.\n\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.\n\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday.\"\nWhen asked if there will be planned talks during the international break regarding his future, Amorim said: 'I'm always talking with the board and I understand the context, the feeling, everything. So I understand that sometimes I say some things.\n\"Again, I will say it again when we have these kinds of moments. Today was a good day, but it was just a win. For me, it's to look at the game, we should have won in a different way.\n\"We should not suffer. And we return a little bit our level against Arsenal, a little bit against Fulham. And today was more or less the same.\"",

        "title": "Alejandro Garnacho joins Chelsea: Man Utd winger leaves club in £40m transfer as Blues spending nears £300m",
        "content": "Chelsea have signed Alejandro Garnacho in a £40m transfer from Manchester United, taking their summer spend to nearly £300m.\nThe 21-year-old winger becomes Chelsea's ninth arrival, joining new attackers Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens, and increases their outlay to £296.8m.\nChelsea, though, have recouped £314.4m in sales with 26 players exiting the club either in permanent transfers or on loan.\nGarnacho has signed a long-term deal at Chelsea and says he is happy to be joining \"the best team in the world\".\n\"I can't wait to get started,\" he told the Chelsea website. \"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"\nA compromise over Garnacho's valuation had to be reached as United valued him at £50m, which was more than Chelsea were prepared to pay.\nUnited negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.\nThe deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate.\n\nGarnacho turned down offers from other clubs because he wanted to move to Chelsea. The winger was told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.\n\nChelsea are pulling out of the Nicolas Jackson loan deal to Bayern Munich.\nBayern have been informed that Chelsea will not be able to proceed with the proposed deal due to an injury to Liam Delap against Fulham.\nThe decision to cancel Jackson's loan was taken after discussions this afternoon between Chelsea's football leadership team and head coach Enzo Maresca.\nThe player is now expected to return to London. He will go straight back into the first-team squad.\nHe has been training with the first-team squad as there was always the possibility he would stay.\nHe signed an extension last September and his contract runs to 2033.\nChelsea have sent Barcelona a £36.6m (€40m) written bid for Fermin Lopez.\nThey are now waiting for a response after submitting the offer on Saturday.\nSky Sports News has been reporting that Chelsea would make an offer if they received any encouragement that a deal was possible.\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\n\"We've reported in the past that Chelsea were considering opening bids of £25m. I know some Manchester United supporters were very angry with those reports.\n\"It's all been sorted out now. It's a £40m fixed fee and United will also retain a 10 per cent sell-on clause for the player.\n\"This is a significant deal for United. They are often criticised for not getting enough for players and not making money from selling players. This is the largest ever sale for a Manchester United academy product.\n\"From United's perspective, they are very, very happy because a £40m fixed fee is a very good deal for them, for a player who didn't really have a future at the club.\"\nSpeaking earlier this summer, United boss Amorim said: \"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out.\n\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.\n\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"\nIn\nJamie Gittens - Dortmund, £51.5m\nJoao Pedro - Brighton, £60m\nLiam Delap - Ipswich, £30m\nJorrel Hato - Ajax, £38.5m\nEstevao Willian - Palmeiras, £29m\nDario Essugo - Sporting, £18.5m\nMamadou Sarr - RC Strasbourg, £12m\nKendry Paez - Independiente del Valle, £17.3m\nAlejandro Garnacho - Manchester United, £40m\nOut\nKendry Paez - Strasbourg, loan\nDjordje Petrovic - Bournemouth, £25m\nBashir Humphreys - Burnley, £10m\nDylan Williams - Burton, undisclosed\nMarcus Bettinelli - Man City, undisclosed\nKepa Arrizabalga - Arsenal, £5m\nTeddy Sharman-Lowe - Bolton, loan\nMathis Amougou - Strasbourg, undisclosed\nZak Sturge - Millwall, undisclosed\nNoni Madueke - Arsenal, £52m\nCaleb Wiley - Watford, loan\nMike Penders - RC Strasbourg, loan\nJoao Felix - Al Nassr, £43.7m\nIshe Samuels-Smith - Strasbourg, £6.9m\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall - Everton, £29m\nMamadou Sarr - Strasbourg, loan\nLeo Castledine - Huddersfield, loan\nLesley Ugochukwu - Burnley, £23m\nMarc Guiu - Sunderland, loan\nArmando Broja - Burnley, £20m\nRenato Veiga - Villarreal, £26m\nCarney Chukwuemeka - Borussia Dortmund, £24m\nAaron Anselmino - Borussia Dortmund, loan\nAlfie Gilchrist - West Brom, £1.2m\nBrodi Hughes - AFC Wimbledon, loan\nChristopher Nkunku - AC Milan, £36m\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Jack Grealish stars for Everton, Chelsea go top but have striker issues  - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nGiven that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.\nHe assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.\nBut it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.\nAsked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\" Adam Bate\nSeven points from the opening three games and topping the Premier League table at the close of play on Saturday would bring a smile to the face of most managers.\nBut Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.\nEnzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.\n\nWithin moments of the injury news being confirmed, Sky Sports News reported Chelsea would be pulling out of the deal to send Jackson on loan to Bayern Munich in the wake of Delap's setback.\nThe player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.\nThe start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.\nDifficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.\nJackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red. Patrick Rowe\n\nAmid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.\nHe was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.\nFor a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.\nHis ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.\nUnited have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him. Lewis Jones\n\nThis 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.\nAfter the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.\nOne fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.\nThose wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.\nOn the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.\nA toothless Spurs had just five shots against the Cherries, while Frank's side failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League home game since February 2020.\nHow Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.\nFrank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"\nSpurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this. Declan Olley\nIt would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.\nBut he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.\nThe absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.\n\"We've historically been a really good attacking team and very good chance creation, but it hasn't quite been there,\" Eddie Howe told Sky Sports after the game. \"We're disappointed with that aspect of our play.\"\nAnd that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.\nAnd Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space. Charlotte Marsh\n\nBefore facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.\nAnd he's being proved right.\nIn their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.\nElland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.\nIn fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.\nIf Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good. Charlotte Marsh\n\nInevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.\nAt half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.\nHowever, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.\nFulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.\nBut he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.\nThey battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.\nWhen it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough. Patrick Rowe\n\nWilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.\nEnzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.\nAcross the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.\nDespite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.\nHis work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season. Callum Bishop\nBrentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.\nThe decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.\nBrentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.\nAsked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly. Noah Langford\nOnly West Ham are keeping Wolves off the bottom of the Premier League table and after three defeats from their first three games there is a growing feeling that this could be the season that the club drops back down to the Championship. They are short of quality.\nMatheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.\nPumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.\nThat seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.\nAsked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\" Adam Bate",

        "content": "Newcastle target Yoane Wissa has sensationally demanded to be sold by Brentford before the summer transfer window closes on Monday.\nNewcastle have had multiple offers rejected for Wissa this summer, and the striker has taken to Instagram to reveal his frustrations at a move not materialising as he pushes for a switch to the Magpies before Monday's 7pm deadline.\nBrentford are not commenting on Wissa's bombshell statement.\nSky Sports News has also not seen evidence of the written assurances Wissa speaks of in his statement.\nWissa said: \"Over the past few weeks, there has been increased speculation about my future at Brentford Football Club. As a result, I wanted to speak directly and honestly about exactly where things stand.\n\"I have stayed silent for much of the summer, but with just hours remaining of the transfer window I feel compelled make it clear that I want to leave Brentford. I believe the club are unduly standing in my way despite a series of fair offers throughout the summer.\n\"I have always given 100 per cent for Brentford since the day I signed back in 2021. I am proud of what we have built together and have never taken the opportunity to play for the club for granted.\n\"Brentford fans will always have a special place in my heart. And I have always conducted myself professionally, both on and off the pitch. It has been a privilege to wear this shirt for 149 games and celebrate 49 goals.\n\"Earlier this summer, I held open discussions with the club's senior management, including key directors and the new head coach. I made clear my intention to explore a new challenge.\n\"During these conversations, it was confirmed to me and my representatives that the club would not stand in my way if a reasonable offer was received. This was also put in writing.\n\"Based on this understanding, I sought to find a new club, keeping Brentford informed with full transparency at every step.\n\"I received a formal offer from another Premier League club and communicated I wanted to join. I was under the impression, from all my conversations with Brentford, that there was a mutual agreement to part ways.\n\"Yet as the window comes to an end, the club has now significantly changed its position, going against what was communicated. This has left me in a difficult and frustrating position. The promise that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. It saddens me to have to write that, and I maintain total respect for the club and its fans.\n\"I want to make it clear that I have not acted unprofessionally, nor do I wish to leave Brentford on bad terms. I have been transparent in my position throughout. I have continued to communicate openly with the club and conduct myself in a way that reflects my values as both a footballer and a human being.\n\"I remain hopeful that a fair and reasonable resolution can still be found before the transfer window shuts.\n\"In the meantime, I must do what I feel is right for my career and family and insist that Brentford honour their promise to let me join a new club and at a fair price.\n\"I want to thank all the Brentford fans for their support and understanding during this difficult situation. Your energy and belief in me has always meant a great deal. This has never been about walking away from what is a fantastic football club. It's about being allowed to move forward with Brentford's blessing based on repeated promises that I could leave for a new chapter this summer.\n\"Being made to stay beyond this summer will only tarnish four wonderful years at this incredible club and so I ask Brentford's owners and directors to now honour their promise to let me leave in the final hours of the window.\"\n\nA potential move for Wissa to Newcastle could open the door for Liverpool to make a British-record bid for Toon striker Alexander Isak .\nNewcastle's club-record signing of Nick Woltemade has already increased the likelihood of Isak leaving for Liverpool before the window closes.\nNewcastle have maintained that Isak would only be sold if an adequate replacement was found, and that now appears to be the case.\nHowever, Newcastle will attempt to bring in a second striker before listening to offers from Liverpool, and they have been trying to sign Wissa.\nLiverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid rejected for Isak earlier in the summer, so they will have to increase their offer to reach an agreement with Newcastle.\nSky Sports News' Lyall Thomas:\nBrentford have been willing to engage with Newcastle, but his valuation must be met, and they want to replace him.\nThe Bees are yet to sign a replacement - Dango Ouattara was the replacement for Bryan Mbeumo.\nThey tried for Max Beier but were unable to agree a fee with Borussia Dortmund.\nThey will continue to work hard in the market and are assessing other targets with less than 48 hours to go.\nBrentford have rejected two bids from Newcastle for Wissa so far this summer; one worth £25m and the second worth £40m.",

        "title": "Nicolas Jackson transfer news: Chelsea open to selling striker to Bayern Munich amid talks with Sporting's Conrad Harder",
        "content": "Chelsea are pulling out of Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, but the striker is still in Germany and has not given up hope of his move going ahead.\nBayern were informed that Chelsea will not be able to proceed with the proposed deal after striker Liam Delap suffered an injury against Fulham on Saturday.\nThe German champions' current deal for Jackson would see them pay a £13m up-front loan fee with a £56.2m option to buy.\n\nHowever, if Bayern were prepared to offer an obligation to buy or a permanent deal, then that is a solution Chelsea would consider, but they would need to bring in another striker, and time is running out with very few options available.\nChelsea are in talks with Sporting for striker Conrad Harder . RB Leipzig and AC Milan have been trying to sign him from the Portuguese club this summer.\nMeanwhile, Jackson is in Munich and wants to sign for Bayern. Chelsea have revoked the permission they gave for him to have a medical, and have asked him to return.\nLatest from Sky Sports News' chief correspondent Kaveh Solhekol:\nTalks are going on right now between Chelsea and Bayern Munich about Jackson.\n\nChelsea's position is clear: Jackson is a Chelsea player, so if you want him, then buy him.\nThis is not a bluff; Chelsea are not playing poker.\nEven if Bayern were to agree to sign Jackson, Chelsea would still have to sign a replacement - but there are hardly any strikers available on loan anymore.\nChelsea believe the loan agreement has now been totally revoked. If Bayern believe in Jackson, they have to buy him\nDelap went off injured with a hamstring injury in the 14th minute against Fulham on Saturday, leaving Chelsea with just one senior striker in Joao Pedro.\nThe decision to cancel Jackson's loan was taken after discussions between Chelsea's football leadership team and head coach Enzo Maresca.\n\nChelsea had accepted a record loan fee of £13m from Bayern for Jackson, with an option to buy the 24-year-old for £56.2m.\nJackson arrived in Munich not long after news had broken of Chelsea's intention to pull out of the deal.\nSky in Germany reported that Jackson would not be flying back to London on Saturday in the hope of finding a solution. However, Bayern sporting director Max Eberl later said \"we have to send him back\".\nNothing was signed with Bayern and there was no paperwork, which leaves them helpless. The expectation is that Jackson will return to London and go back into the first-team squad at Chelsea.\nHe has been training with the first team as there was always the possibility he would stay at the club. Jackson signed an extension last September and his contract runs to 2033.\nSpeaking about Jackson's future immediately after Chelsea's victory over Fulham, Maresca said: \"When you have two strikers, it's enough. When one is injured, it probably is not enough.\"\n\nSky Sports News' chief correspondent Kaveh Solhekol:\nNicolas Jackson has to come back to Chelsea. Nothing was signed with Bayern Munich and there is no paperwork.\nHe was given permission to travel and have a medical and that permission has been revoked.\nChelsea have a good working relationship with Bayern - this situation may have been different if this was a permanent deal but Bayern insisted on a loan.\nThis is a unique and awkward situation but the expectation is that everyone is going to act professionally.\nIf this was a permanent deal, Chelsea would be able to use the fee received to buy another forward - but it is not, and in any case, there are very few strikers available in the market at the moment.\nBayern could try to change the deal to a permanent move, but time is running out and potential replacements are scarce. Bayern have made it clear they are only in the market for loans.\nIt's understandable the player is disappointed - he was hoping to become the heir to Harry Kane, but he is a Chelsea player and is contracted until 2033.\nBayern have been informed that Chelsea have no intention of loaning the player and he has been asked to return.\nChelsea's transfer activity ramped up on Saturday as they also sent a formal written bid to Barcelona for Fermin Lopez worth around £36.6m (€40m).\nThey are now waiting for a response. Sky Sports News has been reporting that Chelsea would make an offer if they received any encouragement that a deal was possible.\n\nAC Milan have completed the signing of Christopher Nkunku from Chelsea in a deal that could reach up to more than £36m.\nThe France international has signed a five-year contract with the Serie A side.\nThis deal takes Chelsea's sales for this summer to around £314m.\nThe 27-year-old joined the Blues from RB Leipzig in June 2023 in a £52m deal.\nNkunku struck 18 goals in 62 appearances for Chelsea as he helped Enzo Maresca's side win the Conference League and Club World Cup.",

        "title": "Alexander Isak joins Liverpool: Newcastle striker leaves in British-record £125m deal on Transfer Deadline Day",
        "content": "Liverpool have completed the signing of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak in a British-record deal worth £125m.\nThe deal eclipses the previous record of £115m which Chelsea paid Brighton for Moises Caicedo in 2023 and brings to an end the longest-running saga of this transfer window.\nNewcastle announced Isak's departure in a pointedly-terse 37-word statement that did not thank him or mention any of his achievements: \"Newcastle United can announce the sale of striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a significant British record transfer fee. The Sweden international joined the Magpies from Real Sociedad in 2022 and made 109 appearances in all competitions.\"\nThe Sweden international will wear the No 9 shirt and has penned a six-year deal at Anfield, taking Liverpool's spending to £446m this summer. They have recouped £228m in sales for a net spend of £218m.\n\n\"It's been a long journey to get here,\" said Isak. \"But I'm super happy to be a part of this team, this club and everything it stands for. It's something I'm proud of and I'm really looking forward to it.\n\"I'm just happy it's done and that I can get back to work. I'm looking forward to seeing my team-mates and the fans, and getting back out there.\"\nIsak added: \"I think I have a lot to give, I think I have a lot to improve. I'm a striker but I always want to give as much as possible to the team, mainly goals but much more than that as well. I want to win everything.\"\n\nLiverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected for Isak at the start of August as Newcastle were unwilling to sell their star man without certain conditions being met.\nAlthough Newcastle stressed they valued Isak at £150m, that stance softened in recent weeks as Isak, determined to explore his options, missed their opening games of the season and said \"the relationship can't continue\".\nIsak scored 23 Premier League goals for Newcastle last season and netted their winner in the Carabao Cup final victory over Liverpool at Wembley, which ended the club's 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy.\nNewcastle signed Isak from Real Sociedad in August 2022 for £63m. In total, he scored 62 goals in 109 appearances for the Magpies. To replace Isak, Newcastle have signed Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart and Yoane Wissa from Brentford for a combined fee in the region of £119m.\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie at St James' Park:\n\"We've spoken about this at length for days, weeks and months and here we are, the deal has finally been concluded.\n\"Newcastle's statement is just 37 words, two sentences. It's incredibly short, usually you'd be thanking players and talking about their time at the club.\n\n\"It sums up exactly how the club as a whole feel about Isak's conduct this summer.\n\"This is the guy who scored the winning goal in the Carabao Cup final in March to end 70 years without a trophy at the club.\n\"He was loved by the supporters, there's still posters behind me down the street, there's kids walking around with Isak 14 shirts on.\n\"But this is how he will now be remembered.\"\n\nJuly 15: Liverpool told Isak not for sale in this window after making informal approach to Newcastle - and decide to rival them for Hugo Ekitike instead after being rebuffed.\nJuly 19: Eddie Howe reveals after pre-season friendly defeat at Celtic that Isak travelled with the rest of the squad to Glasgow but he chose to send him home \"due to the speculation around him\".\nJuly 23: Liverpool beat Newcastle to the signing of Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt after the North East club had already missed out on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro.\nJuly 24: Isak is not included in Newcastle's squad for pre-season tour of Asia due to what Newcastle described as a \"minor thigh injury\".\nJuly 24: It later emerges that Isak has informed Newcastle he wants to explore his options in this transfer window.\nJuly 31: Sky Sports News reports that Isak is training individually at former club Real Sociedad's facilities.\nAugust 1: Newcastle reject an official bid from Liverpool for Isak worth £110m plus add-ons.\nAugust 2: Newcastle make formal bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko worth nearly £70m and Isak later flies back to the North East after his personal training camp in Spain.\nAugust 4: The striker returns to Newcastle's training ground for the first time and has trained separately from his team-mates ever since.\nAugust 4: Newcastle up their offer to RB Leipzig for Sesko amid interest from Manchester United.\nAugust 8: Newcastle boss Eddie Howe says \"we would love the player to be with us\" about Isak after he misses friendly win over Espanyol at St James' Park.\nAugust 9: Manchester United beat Newcastle to the signing of Sesko despite their offer to RB Leipzig being lower.\nAugust 16: Isak not included in Newcastle squad for Premier League season opener against Aston Villa - but Howe says \"door is well and truly open\" for a return.\nAugust 19: Isak skips PFA awards and releases a statement on Instagram accusing Newcastle of broken promises, telling the club \"change is in the best interests of everyone\".\nAugust 19: Newcastle release a statement in response to Isak, denying that promises were made to allow Isak to leave and insisting they would welcome him back when he is \"ready to rejoin his team-mates\"\nAugust 28 : Newcastle agree a deal for Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade, which opens the door for Isak to leave St James' Park.\nSeptember 1: Newcastle and Liverpool agree a £125m deal for Isak, with the striker signing a six-year contract at Anfield.",

        "content": "\nPremier League clubs spent more than £3bn on new signings in total, shattering the previous record of £2.44bn set in 2023.\nClubs also set a record for the amount of money recouped from player sales at £1.8bn. The buying and selling added up to an all-time-high net spend of £1.2bn.\nLiverpool spent the most at a record-breaking £446.5m but Arsenal had the highest net spend at £257m, followed by Liverpool at £218.4m, then Spurs and Manchester United.\nAt the other end of the scale, Bournemouth emerged from the window £65.8m in the black after selling a raft of star players, including defenders Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi.\nIsak was the most expensive signing of the window at a British-record £125m, followed by Florian Wirtz at £116.5m, while Hugo Ekitike (£79m, Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool), Benjamin Sesko (£73.7m, RB Leipzig to Man Utd), and Bryan Mbeumo (£71m, Brentford to Man Utd) also made big-money moves. Adam Smith\nIt seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.\nIn a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.\nLiverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.\nNewcastle finally sanctioned the departure of Isak to Liverpool as they completed the £55m signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford having already brought in Nick Woltemade for £69m from Stuttgart.\n\nFurther down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.\nThe No 9 is back in fashion. Nick Wright\nIt was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.\n\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.\n\nThere are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.\nGiven the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.\nAnd so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"\nThe result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off. Adam Bate\nThe Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.\nBrentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.\nSo-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.\nBournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.\nBrighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.\nThe buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.\nAnd as long as the smart recruitment continues, the cycle will go on.

        "title": "Liverpool transfers: How Reds funded their record-breaking window",
        "content": "In a summer which saw Premier League clubs spend unprecedented sums, it was Liverpool who led the way with British-record-breaking deals.\nIn total, Liverpool spent £446m - the most ever spent by a Premier League club in a single window, eclipsing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.\nAlready top of the Premier League again, the champions completed the three biggest transfers of the summer - Alexander Isak for a record £125m, Florian Wirtz for £116.5m and Hugo Ekitike for £79m.\nIn fact, the landmark fee for Isak was more than 10 Premier League clubs spent in the entire window.\nBut how, in the era of PSR, did the champions finance such a huge transfer spend?\nThe Wirtz package in June was enormous in its own right. A £100m outlay to Bayer Leverkusen with the potential for an extra £16m, which would surpass the previous highest fee paid by an English club, when Chelsea bought Moises Caicedo for £115m in 2023.\nBut that was blown out of the water on Deadline Day, with the stunning £125m agreement with Newcastle for Isak.\nIt could have been an even bigger day, but Marc Guehi's £35m switch from Crystal Palace dramatically collapsed .\nBut add in the £40m for Milos Kerkez, £29.5m for Jeremie Frimpong, and £29m that has now gone through for Giorgi Mamardashvili and it has been a relentless summer of spending by the Reds.\nRivals will have looked on enviously - not least those who have had their spending restricted by Profit and Sustainability Rules.\nThe answer to how Liverpool have been able to spend such huge sums and stay within the rules is complex and detailed - but can also be simplified.\n\nPSR limits clubs to outlays relative to their revenues. And Liverpool have big revenues.\nThey turned over £614m in their last set of accounts. By contrast, Newcastle turned over £320m.\nThere have been big sponsorship deals, such as the new link-up with adidas, which is reported to be worth as much as £60m per year over the next decade. Anfield has been expanded to increase matchday income and hospitality takings. There has also been a flood of prize money for achievements in the Premier League, Champions League and the cups in recent years.\nLiverpool have managed their transfer spending across recent windows, too.\nEven including this bumper 2025 splurge, Liverpool only rank seventh among Premier League clubs for net spend since 2016/17. That means when sales are factored in, Liverpool have spent less than the likes of Tottenham and West Ham.\nThink also of how sharply this summer contrasts with last year, when £12.5m Federico Chiesa was the only player signed to immediately go into Arne Slot's first team.\nThe hierarchy have also succeeded in that trickiest of fields - generating significant income from player sales.\nThis summer, Luis Diaz was sold for £65m and Darwin Nunez for £56.6m. They are headline fees but there was also substantial returns for fringe players Jarrell Quansah (£35m), Ben Gannon Doak (£25m), Caoimhin Kelleher (£18m) and Tyler Morton (£15m).\nArsenal (£257m) have had a bigger net spend this summer than Liverpool (£218.4m)\nLiverpool have spent more than any club ever has in a transfer window. But when you deduct the money generated from sales, their net spend ranks fourth among Premier League clubs since 2016.\nHaving the capacity to spend big is one thing - but what has driven Liverpool to splash the cash now from a position of relative strength?\n\"My suspicion is two things,\" the club's former managing director Christian Purslow told Sky Sports News.\n\"They're looking at the competitive position for the first time in many years and they see a genuine opportunity to really dominate British and European football in a way that perhaps hasn't been true over the last few years.\n\"The second element is the financial rules. These are heaven-made for a club like Liverpool.\n\"They have the most superb sponsorship revenue in football - there are household brands around the edge of the pitch every week, massive levels of commercial turnover.\n\"They redeveloped Anfield very successfully, it's packed every week, so their revenues are high and the rules favour clubs like that.\n\"I think they're sensing the financial rules may be changing. We're starting to hear for the first time fans question if the rules are right, and it's stopping big clubs from spending money, like Newcastle and Aston Villa.\n\"My sense is Liverpool are making hay while the sun shines, loading up on talent to put themselves in a position where they're virtually impregnable.\n\"It's brilliant strategic management, terrifying from a football point of view because adding Isak to that team makes them nailed-on favourites and other clubs should be fearful and respectful of how they're running their club.\"\nLiverpool's financial management has allowed them to go all out in the transfer market - but now the window is closed, it's time for those acquired players to deliver on the pitch.",

His experience and leadership will be vital in enhancing our backline while adding a left-sided defender adds further balance to the squad.\n\"He featured heavily in a top league last season, highlighting his qualities, and we are confident he will shine further in a Rangers jersey. I am looking forward to working with him following the conclusion of the international break.\"\nIt is one in, one out in the striking department at Ibrox with Cyriel Dessers leaving after two years at Rangers.\nThe 30-year-old has scored 52 goals in 116 games during his two years at Ibrox.\nHe has joined Panathinaikos in a deal worth around £3.7m, after Rangers had rejected a bid from their Greek rivals AEK Athens earlier in the summer.\nMeanwhile, Oscar Cortes also left on deadline day to join Spanish second division side Sporting Gijon.\nThe 21-year-old had his second loan spell at Ibrox last season, with an obligation to buy triggered in the summer.\nHowever, he departs on loan until the end of this season after making just 21 appearances for Rangers, scoring one goal and providing two assists.",

They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.\nBrentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.\nSo-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.\nBournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.\nBrighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.\nThe buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.\nAnd as long as the smart recruitment continues, the cycle will go on.

        "content": "Newcastle have signed forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford in a deal worth £55m.\nThe deal was completed on Deadline Day with 30 seconds to spare.\nThe Magpies had multiple offers rejected for Wissa this summer and the striker even took to Instagram to reveal his frustration at a move not materialising as he pushed for a switch to their Premier League rivals.\nWissa will wear the No 9 shirt at Newcastle, left vacant by Alexander Isak who completed a move to Liverpool for a British transfer record fee on Deadline Day .\nThe club maintained Isak would only be sold if an adequate replacement was found and, having signed Nick Woltemade in a club-record deal , they have a second forward in Wissa.\nBrentford were willing to engage with Newcastle over Wissa, but wanted his valuation to be met.\nSpeaking to the club's official website, Wissa said: \"I'm really happy to be here and to sign for one of the biggest clubs in the Premier League.\n\"I'm very excited to put on the black and white shirt. I've got dreams, I've got faith and now I will do my best to make it all happen. I can't wait to get started.\"\nMagpies boss Eddie Howe, added: \"Yoane is a player who we have admired for some time and we're delighted to have him on board.\n\"He brings proven Premier League quality, demonstrated not only by his goalscoring output but also the crucial work he does for the team.\n\"Yoane's style of play will excite our supporters and complement our style of play - he has pace, power and an excellent work rate. He immediately makes us stronger.\"\n\nWissa posted on Sunday: \"I have stayed silent for much of the summer, but with just hours remaining of the transfer window I feel compelled make it clear that I want to leave Brentford. I believe the club are unduly standing in my way despite a series of fair offers throughout the summer.\n\"I have always given 100 per cent for Brentford since the day I signed back in 2021. I am proud of what we have built together and have never taken the opportunity to play for the club for granted.\n\"Brentford fans will always have a special place in my heart. And I have always conducted myself professionally, both on and off the pitch. It has been a privilege to wear this shirt for 149 games and celebrate 49 goals.\n\"Earlier this summer, I held open discussions with the club's senior management, including key directors and the new head coach. I made clear my intention to explore a new challenge.\n\"During these conversations, it was confirmed to me and my representatives that the club would not stand in my way if a reasonable offer was received. This was also put in writing.\n\"Based on this understanding, I sought to find a new club, keeping Brentford informed with full transparency at every step.\n\"I received a formal offer from another Premier League club and communicated I wanted to join. I was under the impression, from all my conversations with Brentford, that there was a mutual agreement to part ways.\n\"Yet as the window comes to an end, the club has now significantly changed its position, going against what was communicated. This has left me in a difficult and frustrating position. The promise that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. It saddens me to have to write that, and I maintain total respect for the club and its fans.\n\"I want to make it clear that I have not acted unprofessionally, nor do I wish to leave Brentford on bad terms. I have been transparent in my position throughout. I have continued to communicate openly with the club and conduct myself in a way that reflects my values as both a footballer and a human being.\n\"I remain hopeful that a fair and reasonable resolution can still be found before the transfer window shuts.\n\"In the meantime, I must do what I feel is right for my career and family and insist that Brentford honour their promise to let me join a new club and at a fair price.\n\"I want to thank all the Brentford fans for their support and understanding during this difficult situation. Your energy and belief in me has always meant a great deal. This has never been about walking away from what is a fantastic football club. It's about being allowed to move forward with Brentford's blessing based on repeated promises that I could leave for a new chapter this summer.\n\"Being made to stay beyond this summer will only tarnish four wonderful years at this incredible club and so I ask Brentford's owners and directors to now honour their promise to let me leave in the final hours of the window.\"\nBrentford did not comment on Wissa's statement.\nSky Sports News has not seen evidence of the written assurances Wissa speaks of in his statement.",

        "content": "Aston Villa completed the Deadline Day signings of Jadon Sancho, Harvey Elliott and Victor Lindelof to provide Unai Emery with some much-needed reinforcements.\nSancho joined on a straight loan deal from United with Villa paying 80 per cent of the player's wages during his time at Villa Park.\nThe 25-year-old has entered the final year of his contract at Old Trafford, with United having the option to extend for a further 12 months.\n\nSancho, who was signed by United for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2021, spent last season on loan at Chelsea, but returned to United after the west London club paid a £5m penalty to get out of their obligation to buy the player.\nThe 23-times capped England international will provide crucial attacking support for Emery's side, who have failed to score in their opening three Premier League fixtures.\nVilla allowed both Leon Bailey and Jacob Ramsey to leave the club this summer, meaning Sancho, who is capable of playing on the right or left wing, will offer depth across multiple positions in Emery's squad moving forward.\nVilla remained active in the market throughout Deadline Day and then secured the signing of Liverpool midfielder Elliott on an initial loan deal with a £35m obligation to make the move permanent.\nLiverpool included both a buy-back clause and sell-on clause in the deal.\nThe England U21 international made just one appearance for the Reds in the opening three games of the Premier League season, a one-minute outing off the bench against Newcastle.\nSpeaking in May, Elliott admitted he would need to do \"what's best\" for his career in the summer when asked about his Liverpool future - and now secures a fresh start at Villa.\nElliott made just two starts for Liverpool across his 18 appearances in the top-flight last season, scoring one goal and registering two assists.\n\nHe is capable of playing in central or attacking midfield, as well on the right wing. Emery had previously deployed Marco Asensio in a No 10 role while on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last season, an area Elliott could also be used in.\nFormer Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof has signed a two-year deal at Aston Villa after leaving Old Trafford at the end of his contract in June.\nThe Sweden international left Old Trafford in June after seven years at the club, making more than 250 appearances and winning both the Carabao Cup and Europa League.\n\"It's a massive club, and I was super excited when I heard that the club wanted me,\" Lindelof told the official club website after the signing was confirmed.\n\"Hopefully, I can help the younger players with my experience, and also bring in the quality like I show on the pitch.\n\"I am super, super happy and thrilled to be part of this football club.\"",

        "title": "Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa's transfer sagas could lead to sad day for football over player power, says Jamie Carragher",
        "content": "Jamie Carragher believes the Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa transfer sagas could lead to a \"sad day for football\" in the future - after both strikers effectively went on strike in order to gain their moves.\nIsak and Wissa were two of the key players on a dramatic Transfer Deadline Day. Isak sealed a British record £125m move to Liverpool from Newcastle, while Brentford striker Wissa headed to St James' Park in a deal worth up to £55m.\nBoth players were united in not featuring for their teams in pre-season or the opening three games of the Premier League, though Wissa did make himself available for training before his Brentford exit. Both Isak and Wissa also published explosive statements on social media calling for exits this summer.\nAnother key player on Monday's final day of the window, however, was Marc Guehi - whose £35m deal to Liverpool collapsed after his club Crystal Palace pulled out of the deal.\nThe England international behaved impeccably throughout the window, playing and training for Palace throughout - and Carragher was asked if Isak and Wissa being granted exits for worse behaviour is a worrying sign.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports News , Carragher replied: \"You look at Guehi, who conducted himself fantastically well and still feels a fan favourite with the Palace supporters and the manager speaking highly of him as well. He will have to wait maybe until January now or next summer to get that move.\n\"Other players in this position in a year's time will look at how Isak and Wissa have gone about it and how that gives them a greater opportunity to get out - and that would be a sad day for football. Because I don't think it's been great how both players have conducted themselves.\n\"I have no issue with players wanting to leave a club - transfers happen and it's part and parcel of the game. It's understandable that those two players want to move on and play for bigger clubs to give them a better chance for their careers and to win more silverware, or maybe gain more money.\n\n\"But I can't help but think that if someone is putting thousands of pounds in your bank account every week, you should be training and playing.\n\"But would both those players have moved if that wasn't the case? We don't know. Both players have not got what they want, you have to move on for that. Let's see what happens for both players for Liverpool and Newcastle respectively.\"\nFrom his own experience of a Premier League dressing room, Carragher also feels that Isak and Wissa would have been welcomed back by their previous clubs with open arms if they had not secured their move, making their summer sagas even more troubling.\n\"There were two or three incidents like that when I was a player at Liverpool,\" said Carragher. \"Certainly so when I moved on and notably with Luis Suarez.\n\"But players are like supporters, they can forgive really quickly. When you play a game of football, you want the best players on the pitch. And if someone is giving you a greater chance of winning games or trophies, you get over it.\n\"If either of those players would have stayed at those club - Isak, Wissa or anyone else involved in transfers - it can change really quickly in the eyes of the supporters because as soon as they start scoring goals, everyone's celebrating, people are hugging and kissing them, and it's all forgotten.\"\n\nThe signing of Isak took Liverpool's summer spending to a record £446m - more than any team in a single Premier League window.\nAnd Carragher says it is now hard not to look past Liverpool being Premier League title favourites - especially seeing the Reds be the only team with a 100 per cent record after three matches this term.\n\"When the champions go and spent around £400m in the transfer market, it's hard not to make them favourites,\" Carragher said.\n\"The worrying thing for the opposition is that Liverpool have nine points out of nine and I wouldn't say in any of those three games, they haven't been at their best, or at least the team we saw last season.\n\"It will be interesting to see how long it takes to bed in the new players, the new system, a new way of doing things. If Liverpool are doing that and still getting results, that is a big worry for the rest.\"\n\nCarragher also reacted to the news that Guehi's transfer fell through - despite both Liverpool and Palace submitting the deal sheet to allow them extra time to complete the transfer on Monday night.\nGuehi was given permission to undergo a London medical with Liverpool after the clubs agreed on the £35m fee - but Palace's inability to find a replacement, after Brighton defender Igor Julio chose West Ham instead, was a critical factor.\n\"They would be disappointed because they wanted the player and they didn't get him,\" said Carragher.\n\"There was a lot of talk over the last couple of weeks saying Marc Guehi was more important than bringing Isak in, I don't agree with that at all. Liverpool only had one centre forward - they needed to buy a striker, there's no doubt about that, whether it was Isak or not.\n\"Liverpool have the numbers at centre-back. It's just a question of whether they have the quality. What Liverpool have had in the last year - and what they will have now until Christmas - is no real competition for the first-choice centre-back positions in Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk.\n\"They have two back-up options in Joe Gomez and Giovanni Leoni. So they definitely have four centre-backs, which is what most clubs want. In an emergency, I think Ryan Gravenberch can play there as well. Liverpool will just get to January and then try to resurrect the Guehi deal.\n\"But what Guehi would have done was have three centre-backs for two positions - create real competition, certainly for Konate.\n\"We understand there's a situation with Konate's contract and Van Dijk is getting older. So Liverpool did need a centre-back.\n\"But it wasn't as imperative as bringing in a striker, as Hugo Ekitike wouldn't have been able to lead the line on his own until Christmas.\"",

        "title": "Gianluigi Donnarumma to Man City: Italian goalkeeper arrives as one of the best in the world - but is he the right No 1 for Pep Guardiola?",
        "content": "August 2015. AC Milan were playing Tottenham in a pre-season Audi Cup game at Munich's Allianz Arena. Watching on was Bayern Munich head coach Pep Guardiola.\nAfter the game, Guardiola approached someone who caught his eye - a 16-year-old goalkeeper who came on at half-time called Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\"He played out the back a lot in that game,\" recalls Alfredo Magni - AC Milan's goalkeeper coach at the time - to Sky Sports . \"He was very supportive to the team by getting involved in many pieces of play.\n\"And Guardiola, at the end of the game, came up to congratulate him for his inclination to play out.\"\nA decade later, Guardiola has approached Donnarumma in a different manner. The Manchester City manager has called on the Italian goalkeeper to become his No 1. But this time he is not a young prodigy. He has now developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the world, if not the standalone best.\nCity had Ederson in their squad - a title and treble-winning goalkeeper. They also spent £27m for James Trafford, who has the potential to become City and England's No 1 for a generation or two.\nBut City's late move for Donnarumma this summer proves one simple thing: when someone of his stature becomes available, you just get him. No matter the context.\nThis is a European Championship winner with Italy. A current Champions League winner. And not just a champion by name, but one very much central to those successes.\nIn Italy's Euro 2021 success, he saved three penalties across two shoot-outs in the semi-final and final victories over Spain and England respectively - and was subsequently named the player of the tournament.\nEven this year, while Paris Saint-Germain's attacking stars lit up the Champions League, particularly in the 5-0 final win over Inter, it is worth remembering Donnarumma's five, crucial stops across both semi-final legs against Arsenal.\nA player at the top of his game in his prime years, a key part of Donnarumma's aura is his 'been there, done that' experience. As well as those big moments delivered on the grandest stage, it is worth noting he has played in Europe's top five leagues for 10 years - and he is still only 26.\nHis development started in December 2014 when Magni spotted him playing in AC Milan's academy as a 14-year-old. He was such a big talent that Milan's goalkeeper coach personally approached owners Silvio Berlusconi and Adriano Galliani for permission to promote him to the first team.\n\"Anyone who saw him would notice he had something special,\" he says. \"He began a path that involved technique, but more so the physical aspect of his game.\n\"As well as the technical side of things, I wanted him to become a goalkeeper that even saved the shots that were far away from him and out of reach, so he wouldn't do just the bare minimum and only think about not making mistakes.\n\"But the important thing that we worked on him with, in my opinion, was injury prevention, the support and reinforcement of the body, and he has never picked up injuries in his career. And that started when he was 14, and developed even more at 18. He worked a lot on this aspect.\"\nWhile many have pointed out that Donnarumma's shot-stopping is his best trait, Magni disagrees.\n\"It's his attitude to learn and make the coach's requests happen,\" he says. \"His greatest quality - in addition to his physicality, is the talent to learn things and to apply what is asked of him on the pitch.\n\"Attitude is one thing, but traits are another. If someone has the attitude to do something, they put it into those traits. This is his greatest quality.\n\"He is geared to learning, which is part of his talent. When you face difficulties, you react in order to overcome the problems. He is really talented at this.\"\nIt is an important talking point when it comes to how Donnarumma fits in at Manchester City. Can he become the goalkeeper that Man City want?\nHaving a goalkeeper who is not primed to Guardiola's demands has already been noted this season in James Trafford's high-profile mistake during City's 2-0 home defeat to Spurs - and there are already concerns about Donnarumma's own technical style.\n\n\"His distribution is not good enough for a Guardiola team,\" said French football expert Julien Laurens to Sky Sports News this summer. So is he still that goalkeeper who played out from the back so fearlessly as a 16-year-old under Guardiola's gaze?\n\"It's not that he cannot play with his feet, but it hasn't been put forward to him by the coaches in the way that he can do it,\" says Magni.\nAnd that adaptability and desire to learn will come useful in this City set-up. While Guardiola likes his team to play out from the back with short passes to the defenders, there is also an importance of going long - as Ederson has done so often in the past.\nAfter all, the Brazilian registered seven assists in his Premier League career via those long balls, four of them coming last season.\nAs Magni puts it: \"It's all on a cognitive level: playing out the back, or going long, where you're kicking the ball far away, quickly, so that a numerical superiority materialises.\n\"Any request of the coach, playing out of the back or going longer, Donnarumma has the ability to work with the requests of the coach.\n\"And I can guarantee that he has the aptitude to fulfil Guardiola's requests - in terms of his talent and aptitude.\"\nAnother criticism Donnarumma has faced is his inability to claim crosses. It contributed to PSG conceding 31 per cent of last season's goals from set-pieces. \"He doesn't like it,\" said Laurens. \"If there is one league in the world where you have to be brave like that, it's the Premier League.\"\nAgain, those criticisms are a surprise - given another big strength is his reading of the game - having worked under some big names in football. Luis Enrique, Mauricio Pochettino, Filippo Inzaghi and Gennaro Gattuso to name a few.\n\"I know this for sure, Gianluigi is a very attentive person. He knows the game,\" says Magni. \"Despite being 26 years old, he's had a lot of coaches. He's had the chance to really know the game and communicate it in the right way.\n\"He's someone who contributes a lot - not just when it comes to covering the goal but also when it comes to covering the space when the ball is far away. That's where the goalkeeper needs to communicate to the defender. He runs, he gets up, he's there.\"\nWith the likes of Kyle Walker and Kevin De Bruyne departing City this summer, there is the need for experienced players on the highest level. Donnarumma fits the bill - but whether he fits stylistically is still up in the air.",

He made 161 appearances in total after joining from AC Milan in 2021 and kept 56 clean sheets.\nMeanwhile, a loan deal for City defender Manuel Akanji to Inter Milan was also confirmed on Tuesday morning.\nInter confirmed there is an option to make the transfer permanent, which will become an obligation if certain conditions are met.\nSky in Italy are reporting that the loan fee is £900,000 (€1m) and the obligation to buy is £13m (€15m).\nAC Milan and Crystal Palace had earlier expressed an interest in Akanji, who joined City in September 2022.\nThe defender was a key component of the side that won the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble in 2023, and the team which won the domestic title again in 2024.\nSky Sports Sam Blitz:\nAugust 2015.

We saw it the other day with James Trafford trying to play out against Tottenham. Gianluigi Donnarumma will have to play out.\n\"Even though Donnarumma's a top goalkeeper, he's going to be completely out of his comfort zone playing out from the back every week.\n\"When you're playing out from the back, you've got to know everything.

        "content": "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.\nThis week's Between the Lines , a new Sky Sports strand breaking down the data behind the biggest stories in football, picks out some of the spending and selling trends from an historic window.\n\nLiverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.\nTheir British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.\nThe Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.\nWhile Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.\nThe Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, closely followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.\nOther lucrative sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.\nChelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.\n\nBoth Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.\nArsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.\nThere were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.\nThe only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.\nThe books will need to be balanced further down the line\nAnother trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.\nAs recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue clubs target Premier League-ready additions.\nMore than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.\nLiverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.\nManchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.\n\nThe money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.\nThe scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.\nItaly's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.\nSpending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.\nIn terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.\nIncredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m at £141.4m.\nThe numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.\nAnimated graphics by Jim Letham, video editing and cover image by Joda Burgan.\nWhere did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

        "title": "Marc Guehi's failed Liverpool transfer on dramatic Deadline Day: Views from inside Crystal Palace explained",
        "content": "Marc Guehi remains a Crystal Palace player after his Deadline Day move to Liverpool collapsed.\nPalace and Liverpool had agreed a £35m deal for Guehi following his man-of-the-match performance in the win at Aston Villa on Sunday and he was given permission to undergo a medical in London.\nA deal sheet was then submitted to the Premier League to take the Guehi negotiations beyond Monday's 7pm deadline - but Palace then ultimately decided not to sell.\nWhat could the fallout be for Palace's manager, captain and owner? Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol and Rob Dorsett explain...\n\nKaveh Solhekol\nDeadline Days are usually nerve-wracking but this was a particularly tense and stressful one for Crystal Palace. With time running out, chairman Steve Parish had a big decision to make - sell his captain to Liverpool for £35m or risk losing him for nothing next summer. In the end, Parish felt he had to do what was in the best interests of his club and that is why he made the decision to call off Guehi's move to Liverpool.\nAfter Liverpool had been told the deal was off, it was time to call his manager Oliver Glasner. Glasner had been outspoken about why Palace could not afford to sell Guehi and in the end he got what he wanted. Next, it was time to tell Guehi in face-to-face talks that the deal was off and it is fair to say the player was disappointed with the way things had turned out. He had not been agitating for a move earlier in the summer, but when Liverpool came in for him it was a move he wanted to make.\nThe move would have gone through if Palace had been able to sign a centre-back who could slot into the side in place of Guehi. Glasner was willing to accept a player like Manuel Akanji but he ended up moving to Inter Milan and when moves for other targets got nowhere, Parish felt he had to act in the best interests of Palace.\nPalace did sign 19-year-old Jaydee Canvot from Toulouse for £23m. He is one of the most promising young centre-backs in Europe, but he is not the finished article yet and someone with more experience was needed as well.\nThe move would also have certainly happened if Liverpool had been willing to increase their offer. Liverpool were unwilling to bid against themselves and had no intention of offering more than £35m.\nTalks about a move only started when the two sides played each other at Wembley in the Community Shield on August 10. Liverpool wanted Guehi but they were not willing to pay above £35m for a player who will be a free agent next summer.\n\nRob Dorsett\nPalace were looking at options. Glasner was clear that he doesn't think Canvot covers a Guehi-sized hole in his squad.\nThey tried for Akanji, and they thought they had a solution in Igor Julio. He was in the building, he was having a medical, and then there were delays with Guehi and suggestions he might be returning to Crystal Palace.\nIgor got cold feet at that point, because he had been told he'd be playing a lot of football and would be one of the first names on the team-sheet at Palace in Guehi's absence. Igor's team had concerns that if Guehi didn't go, that might affect him. He's played very little football for six months at Brighton and wanted to get minutes.\nIgor then decided at the last minute to go to West Ham. Remember, West Ham had to put a deal sheet in to get his signing over the line, so it was very late in the day for them to make the switch.\nI have a lot of sympathy for Palace here, knowing they have one of their best players, their talisman, their captain, who is worth an awful lot more than £35m, potentially leaving for nothing next summer. Or they sell him, get £35m for the club, and upset Glasner.\nIn the end it's Guehi who is very upset having missed out on his dream move to Liverpool and the circumstances in which it happened. I've been told he was actually in the medical scanner, undergoing his Liverpool medical, when he was told the deal was off.\nIt was an impossible situation for Steve Parish too.\n\nMy understanding is that Guehi didn't want to go to Tottenham or Newcastle in the winter window - Spurs were in real trouble in the Premier League at the time and Guehi wants to be in the Champions League and challenging for trophies.\nHe wasn't sure about Newcastle either. It's difficult for Palace in that scenario, if a player doesn't want to go and they missed out on a possible £65-70m as a result.\nIt's been a complicated situation for Palace for a long time now, but ultimately they've lost out on a big, big asset who we expect to leave for nothing next summer.\nThat's difficult for Palace fans to stomach, but it was a no-win for them either way it turned out.\nKaveh Solhekol\nIt's fair to say Parish and Glasner had some frank exchanges of views about Guehi. They discussed the implications of selling him on Saturday and on Monday Glasner decided to pass on some of the potential replacements which were put in front of him.\nWith time running out, Parish felt he had no other option but to call the deal off. With Eberechi Eze gone and Ismaila Sarr and Adam Wharton injured, he could not risk undermining his manager by selling one of the best centre-backs in the world in the final hours of the window. Glasner was relieved when he was told his captain was staying. Parish made what he thought was the best decision for the club and it was the decision his manager wanted him to make.\nLike Guehi, Glasner is out of contract next summer and at the moment it is looking unlikely that he will sign a new deal. Palace are in four competitions and one of the big priorities is now going to be on winning the Conference League so that they can qualify for Europe again next season.\nIt's not going to be easy, but it can't be ruled out when you have an elite defender and captain of the calibre of Guehi - at least until January.\nRob Dorsett\nI've been told there is now a strained relationship between Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi. Guehi is convinced Glasner had a big part to play in his failure to move to Liverpool.\nGuehi did want to go to Liverpool and feels that has been taken away. But the difference is that he's such a good character, that he won't agitate or sulk. He will do what he's always done for Palace, which is serve them for the remainder of his contract and remain professional.\nIt's been made clear to me some of the biggest clubs in Europe are interested in him, and he can talk to them in January ahead of what is likely to be a big window for him next summer.",

        "title": "Liverpool's transfer window: How sporting director Richard Hughes plotted post-Jurgen Klopp life and record-breaking summer spend",
        "content": "Richard Hughes took on the seemingly impossible job when agreeing to become Liverpool sporting director in March last year.\nThis summer the Scot has broken the British transfer record by signing Alexander Isak, while overseeing the biggest transfer spend in the club's history.\n\nThis is how he did it.\nAfter Michael Edwards agreed to return to Liverpool under a new, expanded brief of chief executive of football for Fenway Sports Group [FSG] in March 2024, the very first thing he did was pick up the phone to Hughes, on gardening leave at the time having just decided to quit as Bournemouth's technical director.\nThe duo's close relationship dates back some 20 years to when Hughes was a hard-working midfielder and captain of Harry Redknapp's exciting Portsmouth side and Edwards a performance analyst on the south coast, with the two, both deep thinkers, striking up an immediate bond over analysing the game.\nNot officially due to start his role until June 2024, and with a to-do list that not only included negotiating new contracts for three of Liverpool's biggest stars - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah - but also somehow finding a successor to Jurgen Klopp, the new man appeared to have been handed a hospital pass.\nThe latter was the more urgent priority given Klopp's near decade-long stay at Anfield was coming to an end, although Liverpool had already been dealt a blow with the news Xabi Alonso - their former midfielder who had been heavily tipped to replace the German - would be staying as Bayer Leverkusen manager.\nRuben Amorim, one of Europe's most sought-after young coaches having guided Sporting Lisbon to the brink of a second Portuguese title, was now reportedly the front runner for the role, but Hughes had other ideas.\nHaving pored over the data supplied to him by the club's director of research, Will Spearman, Hughes knew there was only one candidate he wanted to speak to and in April flew to the Netherlands to meet Feyenoord head coach Arne Slot at his home in Zwolle.\nThe Dutchman had scored highly when it came to both improving players and keeping them fit, while importantly unlike with Amorim, he played the same formation and style of football as Klopp.\nSlot has recounted how Hughes came to that first meeting armed with huge folders of detailed information on him and his team, joking the Scot knew stuff about him even he did not.\n\"Liverpool were so clear they wanted to have me, and they knew everything about me,\" he said. \"Immediately it was: 'OK.' Richard knew many, many, many games and many of the assessments I've made during games - the changes I made in tactics. Julian [Ward, FSG's technical director] visited the [Feyenoord] training ground and spoke with a lot of people trying to get some knowledge for the club and how I worked. There was not a stone unturned.\"\nTo the outside world, Slot's appointment was viewed as a risk given he had relatively little Champions League experience and only won two major trophies in Holland. Hughes, though, backed his judgement, just as he did when taking the unpopular decision not to stick with his friend Gary O'Neil as Bournemouth manager in the summer of 2023, but to go with the relatively unknown Basque Andoni Iraola.\nBoth would turn out to be shrewd appointments. However, with Liverpool's underwhelming summer 2024 transfer window seeing the arrival of only two players, one of whom in Giorgi Mamardashvili immediately loaned out and the other in Federico Chiesa arriving under an injury cloud, the pressure from outside was already mounting.\nHughes' early standing with the club's supporters was not helped either by his failure to get the £51m Martin Zubimendi deal over the line after flying to Spain in August having been assured by the holding midfielder he wanted to move to Anfield, only for a late change of heart from the Spain international.\nHowever, while many Reds supporters fumed over the club's lack of transfer activity, Hughes stayed cool in the knowledge Slot's training-ground coaching - including the pivotal decision to drop Ryan Gravenberch back as a No 6 - would improve a squad which had led the Premier League table at the start of that April.\nAnd so the duo agreed to play the 2024-25 season with Klopp's squad, allowing Slot to make judgement calls on players at the end of that campaign.\n\"Jurgen left the team in a good place and we are trying to build from there,\" said Slot on the eve of the season. \"We're not changing everything. Actually, we [didn't] change that much because many things were already good.\"\nEither way, all eyes were on Hughes in the opening weeks of the campaign to see how the team would perform without Klopp on the touchline, but despite Slot making a record-breaking start to life as Liverpool head coach, the Scot now needed to secure the futures of the club's 'big three'.\nVan Dijk, Salah and Alexander-Arnold's contracts all expired the following summer, meaning all three could start negotiating with foreign clubs as early as January 2025.\nHughes confided he was hopeful of keeping one of the trio, but as the season progressed, even that prospect looked bleak with Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk's camps both silent, unlike Salah, who revealed \"no one\" from Liverpool had talked to him and it would \"probably\" be his last season at the club in an on-pitch interview with Sky after a 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September.\nThe Egypt forward, in the midst of his best-ever season at Anfield, kept the heat on Hughes by revealing he had still to be offered a new deal and was \"probably more out than in\" after his double helped keep the Reds top of the Premier League with a comeback win at Southampton last November.\nThe Glaswegian has a reputation as a \"fierce negotiator\" who is ice-cool even in the most pressurised situations, described by one agent as a \"robot\", while his detailed knowledge of the game is a huge asset when it comes to getting a deal over the line.\n\nHughes speaks four languages after growing up in Milan, where his father Kevin worked for Penguin Books and would take a young Richard, by then picked up by Atalanta's famed Academy, to San Siro to watch Arrigo Sacchi's great AC Milan side of the late eighties and early nineties.\nThese skills and knowledge would come in handy as Hughes continued to seek a breakthrough in negotiations with the trio's agents, including Ramy Abbas, the tough Colombia-born lawyer who represented Salah.\nVan Dijk and soon-to-be crowned double Footballer of the Year Salah eventually agreed new two-year deals in April as the Reds closed in on the title and although Hughes was unable to persuade Alexander-Arnold to extend his stay with his boyhood club, keeping two out of three still represented a fine achievement from the Scot.\nHughes barely had time to sit back and bask in the glow of Liverpool's record-equalling 20th top-flight title, masterminded by the coach he had brought to Anfield, before unusually for a team that has just been crowned champions, embarking on a major summer rebuild spearheaded by Florian Wirtz's arrival from Bayer Leverkusen.\nThe best young player in Germany was expected to join either Bayern Munich or Man City, only for Hughes, along with Slot and Edwards, to convince the 22-year-old his future instead lay at Anfield with another in-depth pitch to him and his parents.\n\n\"It was not easy for me to decide, but I think the talks with the coach and Richard and everybody were, from the start or from the very first time, so good and it just kept going like this,\" Wirtz said of his decision to join Liverpool in a then British-record £116m move in May.\n\"Every time I spoke to one of the [people from] the club I felt like, 'this is the place I want to be' and so in the end I was really 100 per cent convinced I want to join Liverpool and it was the best choice.\"\n\nWirtz's shock arrival bore all hallmarks of the sort of audacious transfers Edwards used to regularly pull off during his time as Hughes' predecessor, such as Van Dijk's arrival for a word-record fee for a defender before the 2018 January window had even opened.\nHowever, the data from Spearman and his team told Hughes this was a generational talent Liverpool could simply not pass up on if the opportunity arose, despite the eye-watering numbers involved, as was also the case with Alexander Isak's stunning move from Newcastle United.\nSlot's side scored a league-high 86 goals en route to last season's Premier League, before signing France striker Hugo Ekitike in July for £79m to replace the departing Darwin Nunez in a move Hughes laid the groundwork for the previous summer, leading some to question why the Reds needed another No 9.\nAccording to their statistical models, though, the Swede ranked alongside only Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland when it came to Europe's top marksmen, resulting in a summer-long transfer pursuit made more spicy by the fact Newcastle manager Eddie Howe is one of Hughes' closest friends from their playing days at Fratton Park and then Bournemouth.\n\nBusiness is business, however, with Hughes putting aside a two-decades long association to get a British-record transfer over the line, even after the window had officially shut on Transfer Deadline Day.\nThat £125m Isak deal took the champions' spending this window to a record £446m, also easily surpassing their own previous highest total of £177m under Edwards after Klopp's side had just won the Champions League in the summer of 2019.\nHughes, though, has also managed to bring in an eye-catching £218.4m from player sales this summer - on top of the £62.5m he generated in his first-ever window in charge - meaning incredibly, the Reds' net spend [£218.4m] was actually less than Arsenal's [£257m].\nFor Hughes, it has been pretty much non stop since taking up the role, barely having time to holiday with his wife and five kids in Crete, before working till the conclusion of Deadline Day to get the Marc Guehi move finalised, only to miss out on the defender when Crystal Palace pulled the plug late on.\nMeanwhile, in recent days Hughes also had to negotiate James McConnell's new deal and loan to Ajax, as well as a contract extension for Cody Gakpo, and he must now turn his attention to persuading Ibrahima Konate to commit his long-term future to the club.\nBut that can all wait as the Liverpool sporting director enjoys a well-earned international break, before no doubt trying to resurrect the Guehi deal when the window re-opens in January.",

        "title": "Man Utd transfer news: A look into how the Red Devils navigated Ruben Amorim's first summer window",
        "content": "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.\nA 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.\nHaving arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on the final day.\nWithin that there were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis respectively, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett provides an insight into the club's transfer strategy this summer...\nManchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:\n1) Is the squad better now, than the one that ended last season?\n2) Did they get all of their primary marquee targets?\n3) Did each of the signings fit the club's new parameters in terms of age, profile and cost?\n4) Did they manage to move on those high-earning players that are not part of Amorim's plans?\nEven the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".\nThat is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.\nIt is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.\n\nAnd they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.\nBut the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.\nThey won't shy away from that, and they feel confident that they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.\nThe juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.\nUnited's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and some pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.\nFinancial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.\nSo why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.\nFor a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).\nBefore trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.\nIn United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.\nVery simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.\nBy contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.\nIn fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.\nIt would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.\nLook at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...\nPlenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?\nThat is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.\nInstead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.\n\nLast season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.\nJust £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.\nThe club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.\nAnd they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.\n\nRashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.\nThere is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.\nThe \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).\nSancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.\nUnited won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.\nBut this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.\nMany United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.\nGary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"\n\nSky Sports News has been told that, while midfield is an area Wilcox would like to strengthen in the right circumstances, it has not been the top priority. And if you look carefully at United's midfield, you can see they already have four full internationals there.\nAmorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.\nUnited would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.\nA young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.\nWhy would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.\nThe United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.\nThey feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.\nThe hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",

        "title": "Transfer window trends revealed as Premier League spending hits £3.19bn and domestic trading increases",
        "content": "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.\nThis week's Between the Lines , a new Sky Sports strand breaking down the data behind the biggest stories in football, picks out some of the spending and selling trends from an historic window.\n\nLiverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.\nTheir British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.\nThe Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.\nWhile Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.\nThe Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.\nOther sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.\nChelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.\nBoth Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.\n\nArsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.\nThere were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.\nThe only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.\nThe books will need to be balanced further down the line.\nAnother trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.\nAs recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.\nMore than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.\nLiverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.\nManchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.\n\nThe money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.\nIt all added up to an eye-watering combined total.\nThe scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.\nItaly's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.\nSpending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.\nIn terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.\nIncredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.\nThe numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.\nWhere did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

        "title": "Millie Bright: Chelsea have quadruple in sights after watching Arsenal lift Champions League trophy last season",
        "content": "Chelsea captain Millie Bright laid down a marker to the WSL in her desire to fill the one empty spot in their trophy cabinet this season - and bring home the Champions League as part of a quadruple challenge.\nDespite going unbeaten in the WSL, lifting the league title for a sixth year in a row and winning the domestic treble, Bright and her team-mates were forced to sit on the sidelines and watch Arsenal secure the Champions League with a shock victory against Barcelona in May, after they had been knocked out by the Spanish giants in the semi-finals.\n\"There's plenty of space in the cabinet,\" she tells Sky Sports ahead of the new season - which starts with a bumper televised clash against Man City on Friday night. \"No matter what competition we're competing in, we'll always be going for it.\n\"It was a massive, massive win for Arsenal. I think it did a lot for English football as well.And I think wherever an English team wins the Champions League, it's massive and it just projects that spotlight into the WSL, which is what we want.\n\"But for me, Sonia [Bompastor] has made no mistake in letting everyone know that we're going for the quadruple. I think it's the DNA of being a Chelsea player.\n\"I know everyone so desperately wants us to fall and everyone wants to beat Chelsea. But we're here to make sure that we do it again.\n\"We don't just leave one trophy to win another. We want all four. So we're absolutely going for the quadruple. But of course, the Champions League is the one that we want.\"\nThe Gunners not only laid down a marker with that Champions League win, but have also broken the £1m barrier for the first time to bring in Liverpool's Olivia Smith ahead of the new campaign.\nThough Renee Slegers' side finished runners-up to Bright's Chelsea last season, they ended 12 points adrift at the top with the Blues' final months of the season a relative procession to the title.\nThe Chelsea skipper is relishing the return of a closer title race after watching their rivals strengthen, with the WSL prize having gone to the final day of the season in each of the previous four campaigns.\n\"I think as a player and especially in the women's game, we fight for each other,\" she says. \"We want every team to be making big signings. We want every team to be strengthening.\n\"We want every title that we compete for to be hard. You never want an easy title. And there has been no easy title, for the record.\n\"Every single season has been challenging and difficult for many reasons. There's more than just two or three teams competing now. There's four or five teams competing for the league, which is incredible.\n\"Again, the growth of the WSL has been amazing to watch. And again, it's exciting as a player. You have to go to another level. You have to perform.\n\"You have to be even better. And then you have to make sure that your club is the one performing and lifting the trophies at the end of the year.\"\nOn the topic of building back, Bright may have given herself a leg up with an initially controversial decision to withdraw from this summer's Euro 2025 tournament, to give herself time to physically and mentally recharge.\nAn almost guaranteed Lionesses starter, Bright's call, only days before Sarina Wiegman's squad announcement, to make herself unavailable for the competition appeared to shock her manager and the footballing world.\nAnd given their successful run to retain the title she held high in 2022, she could have easily looked back with regret, but she knew long before their final date with Spain in late July that she had made the right call.\n\"At no point was I feeling that I should have or I shouldn't have [gone]. And I think when you know that, I was at peace with my decision. And it's my choice. I made the call.\n\n\"Mentally and physically, I wasn't in a position to go. And for the first time, I prioritised myself, which I don't normally do. I've played with many injuries over the years.\n\"And I've done that for the Lionesses and Chelsea for many, many years. But at some point, we are human. And I think sometimes we forget that as athletes as well. You push and you push and you push.\n\"But unfortunately, I'm not a robot and I needed to fix a few little things. So, yes, I'm in a really good place.\"\nBright is less certain about her England prospects, an inevitable question mark given the Lionesses' success in her absence and the concerns which may arise over her international commitment. There has been no conversation with Wiegman since the final - yet.\nBut in time, that will take care of it self. Just as Bright has taken care of herself, now back refreshed with the Champions League, and of course a seventh-consecutive WSL title, firmly in her sights.\nWatch Chelsea vs Man City live on Sky Sports Football from 6.30pm on Friday, kick-off 7.30pm",

        "content": "Fancy the fixture computer blessing us with a title crunch match in week one. Lucky devils. Chelsea vs Manchester City feels like the perfect icebreaker, doesn't it?\nThe six-time reigning champions, who have not lost in the league since May 2024, get their first chance to throw down the gauntlet, while new Man City boss Andree Jeglertz gets a proper introduction to the league from the best in the business.\nChelsea's rivals, direct and indirect, have spent all summer plotting their takedown. Perhaps that happens during every off-season, but this feels different.\nSuch a prolonged period of domestic dominance has made them both the envy and enemy of the entire WSL. Clubs have strengthened in the market like never before, spending larger sums than usual as they try to get the jump on Sonia Bompastor's Blues.\nArsenal have gone so far as to spend a million quid on one player. Dramatic. But should add a new level of spice and unpredictability to big games.\nExpect the openness of this year's title chase to be evident as early as Friday night.\n2025 will long be remembered as the year England conquered Europe.\nArsenal beat Barcelona to become Champions League winners for the second time in their history, before the Lionesses reigned supreme at this summer's Euros to claim back-to-back titles.\nWe make that England 2-0 Spain.\nOf that Euros-winning team, nearly all play in the WSL. Chelsea boast six Lionesses, Arsenal have five (with Michelle Agyemang on loan at Brighton), Man City brag four, while Man Utd own three.\nThe domino effect on club rivalries following such a monumental summer should be fascinating. And if you need convincing further, the WSL's talent ranks are even deeper than ever before.\nOf the 30 Women's Ballon d'Or nominees for 2025, over a third play in the English top-flight - meaning the WSL is the best-represented division of any to feature on the shortlist.\n\nBunny Shaw? Alessia Russo? Elizabeth Terland? Sam Kerr? Maybe even Michelle Agyemang?\nThe WSL has some of the best attacking talent on the planet. These players are gladiators.\nRusso is coming off the best season of her career, Shaw and Kerr are raring to go after respective injury hits and people sleep on Terland's tireless consistency.\nAgyemang burst onto the scene at the Euros - is she ready to take the WSL by storm?\nThe bookies favourite for the Golden Boot is Man City's Shaw but, honestly, the field is wide open.\nAnd if you fancy an outside shot, Rachel Daly and Izzy Goodwin could be in the mix too.\nObviously Sam Kerr needs no introduction. So, we won't attempt to give her one, short of marking her injury return as one of the most highly-anticipated moments of the new season.\nKerr has been missing since suffering an ACL rupture back in January 2024 and oh how the league has missed her goals.\nChelsea's social team teased us last week with a picture of their prized striker on Instagram, with a caption reading 'one week to go', and it sent fans into a frenzy.\nShe will be keen to make up for lost time and we're thrilled by the prospect of it.\n\nOlivia Smith was, for a few weeks at least, the most expensive player on the planet and the first to smash through the £1m barrier.\nIf there's ever anyone to take that kind of hype in their stride it's Arsenal's new winger.\nShe's been in the spotlight since she was 15, which is when she made her debut for Canada.\nThe fearless forward got better by the week during her time at Liverpool - seeing how she develops at a title contender surrounded by better players could be electrifying.\nLots of attention has been placed on London City Lionesses' aggressive recruitment drive this summer - and rightly so.\nOther teams have been making bold moves too, though, and it's only fair we shine a spotlight on some of what we consider to be the smartest business.\nEverton are rebuilding and have spent big on holding midfielder Ruby Mace, signalling their intention to move up the league.\nBrighton's capture of Arsenal loanees Rosa Kafaji and Michelle Agyemang could add firepower to a team already on the rise.\nAston Villa bringing Ellie Roebuck back to the UK after a stint in Spain is also a noteworthy signing in Natalia Arroyo's first full season in charge - as is exciting young Japan forward Maya Hijikata.\nLeicester, Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham all go into the season under new management.\nJeglertz is one of the more interesting hires in recent years, promising to empower City's players as he attempts to end their decade-long title drought.\nMartin Ho had success in Norway after stepping out of Marc Skinner's shadow but his first job is to get his Tottenham squad believing again.\nGareth Taylor's bringing his passing style to Liverpool, who have lost not only Smith but captain Taylor Hinds too.\nAs for Leicester, whoever replaces Amandine Miquel - word on the street is Matt Beard - after her surprise sacking has a tough task ahead after plenty of player departures this summer.\nLondon City Lionesses are this year's debutants.\nThe club are a complete anomaly, but nonetheless intriguing - owned by Michele Kang as part of a multi-club model that also includes French club Lyon and US side Washington Spirit.\nThey have plenty of pedigree, with the squad almost unrecognisable from the one that was promoted from the Championship in May.\nDanielle van de Donk, Nikita Parris and Katie Zelem are among the biggest names to be convinced by the project. Twelve new signings have joined in total this summer.\nJocelyn Precheur has got his work cut out to assemble a team ready to compete with the best.\nThe WSL is expanding - a big moment - but to allow the competition to open its doors to 14 clubs from next season, one must be lost.\nHang on, there's a catch. Plot twist!\nAt the end of this year, the team finishing bottom of the WSL will face the third-placed side from WSL2 in an epic winner-takes-all tie.\nCritics are annoyed relegation for the worst team in the WSL isn't automatic but who doesn't love a play-off?\nIt'll be England's cruellest game for the eventual loser but packed with entertainment value for us observers.\n\nBompastor said it herself. To go a full 22-game campaign unbeaten is a \"once in a lifetime\" achievement.\nChelsea broke all sorts of records last season, amassing the most points (60) of any team ever - they had won the title by April, the earliest point it had been claimed for years.\nBut lightening is unlikely to strike twice.\nBompastor will have to find new ways to fend off teams intent on their undoing in year two, which will offer a real examination of the Frenchwoman's tactical discretion.\nShe has made no secret of her desire to get Chelsea playing a prettier style of football - the question is, can they do both?",

Nottingham Forest have replaced a head coach who took them from 17th to Europe, with a head coach whose Premier League position went from Europe to 17th last season.\nPostecoglou's links to Evangelos Marinakis are clear given their shared nationality - plus the fact the Forest co-owner gave the former Spurs coach an award over the summer for becoming the first Greek manager to win the Europa League.\nBut there is an ideological clash here. Postecoglou prided himself on playing attractive, attacking football with high lines, aggressive presses and lots of the ball. He is now entering a squad of Forest players who were drilled in low blocks, counter-attacking breaks and a lack of ball possession under Nuno Espirito Santo.\nThe two styles of Nuno's Forest and Postecoglou's Spurs are polar opposites, and it is confirmed by those who know the technicalities of 'Angeball'.\n\"People just talk about attacking and pressing. That's 100 per cent right,\" a senior source from Postecoglou's Spurs era tells Sky Sports .\n\"The main principles are playing with the purpose of scoring goals, defending aggressively, trying to win the ball as quick as you can. Those are the basic general principles.\"\nBut those principles were not always perceived positively. It added to the perception that Postecoglou wanted to play exactly the same way no matter who the opponent was. And it led to criticism, scepticism, the lot.\n\nSome believed 'Angeball' neglected the defensive side of the game too much, with other claims of the style of play impacting player fitness and injuries. Those inside the Spurs camp, however, saw it differently.\n\"Obviously there's a lot of big talk. People talk, it's this, it's that, and obviously there has to be - and everybody's entitled to their opinion,\" says the same source. \"But I was there and it's not like how people described it.\n\"Every approach was targeted to win and it's not about only playing in a certain way. It's about winning that game.\n\"We did work a lot in defensive things, it didn't get much talk and we did improve throughout the season in that area.\"\nPerhaps the biggest indication of that - and also of Postecoglou not being 'one-style philosophy' manager he was accused of being - came in the latter stages of the Europa League.\n\nSpurs transitioned from a team with one of the highest percentage numbers in the Premier League to not having more than 42 per cent of the ball in the final four games of the Europa League run.\nThey went to Eintracht Frankfurt with the aggregate score level and won 1-0 with just 39 per cent possession. They then had 41 per cent of the ball at home to Bodo/Glimt, winning 3-1 with 24 shots.\nIn the away match in Norway, they had 31 per cent possession - and ended Bodo's record of scoring in every home game for 18 months by winning 2-0. That was not by accident, or by Spurs being tactically inferior or fortunate - those from inside the Spurs dressing room remember that semi-final being a deliberate game plan from Postecoglou to get a result.\nThen in the Europa League final, they had 26 per cent possession against Manchester United, with their one shot on target being their winner.\nIf anything, winning despite having less of the ball sounds a lot like Nuno's Forest.\n\"It was about: how can you win every moment?\" says the same senior figure from Spurs. \"How can you win when the ball is coming from across? How can you win when there's a shot? How can you win if the ball gets over the keeper and Micky van de Ven has to take it away from the line?\n\"Micky did everything there to win, so everybody was thinking like that. And if that means you're defending more, then you're defending more.\n\"The idea in the Europa League was just to win. It's not like the league where you can build your principles consistently and become stronger by going hard on your principles. Of course, in the Europa League you also have your principles, but if you don't win, you're out.\"\nSo what happened in the Premier League, and why was that so dire? For all the Europa League celebrations in Bilbao, Spurs failed to win their final seven top-flight matches of the season.\nThey conceded 65 goals in the Premier League, only the relegated sides and Wolves managed more. They also had the fourth-most errors leading to goals in the league, which vastly contrasted against their perfect Europa League form and style.\n\"For me, it's an easy answer,\" says the same source. \"It seems to be very hard for so many people to understand.\n\n\"But it's: is the team playing Champions League this season? What's different if you then finish 13th or 10th? Does it change anything?\n\"By the time you get to that point in January, February or March and you see your biggest thing to accomplish to get to the Champions League and get to the Europa League win, why would you still try to make the Premier League work? Of course, you want to try to win everything. But is it really possible?\"\nFor the Spurs dressing room and clearly Postecoglou, it was not possible - due to the number of injuries Spurs had. Several members of the squad were hamstrung by setbacks, leading to the likes of Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall to play more minutes as teenagers than they would have liked.\nAt the start of the season, it was not planned that the duo and the other Spurs youngsters would be so heavily involved.\nSo there are several questions that Postecoglou needs to answer at Forest. Has he now fully changed from the 'one-philosophy manager', if he was ever one in the first place? And if not, can he completely turn around Forest's game plan from defensive to attacking? Does his style of play lead to more injuries?\nCrucially, with Forest in the Europa League this season, can he build a team that competes on all fronts?\nThe 17th-place finish in the Premier League with Spurs forced Daniel Levy to pull the trigger, and Marinakis has not proven to be any more forgiving over the years with his standards at Forest.",

        "title": "Thomas Tuchel's England dilemma - what is best starting XI? Selection issues including wingers and No 10 analysed",
        "content": "As comprehensive as England's 5-0 victory over Serbia was on Tuesday night, it has probably left Thomas Tuchel with more questions than answers - in the most positive sense.\nThe England boss got the performance he has been calling for since he took over the reins but now he has a real headache in knowing what his best XI is.\nConsecutive player-of-the-match performances from Elliot Anderson in his first two senior England internationals is probably the biggest plus for Tuchel, because he (like his predecessor Gareth Southgate) has been searching for a natural, consummate No 6 for some time.\nThere was a real gap in the England armoury in that position. Now, not so much. It feels like it is Anderson's position to lose, despite the fact he is still on his international honeymoon and the 2026 World Cup is still nine months away.\nTrouble is, the other players who have impressed in this camp - and against Serbia in particular - are all adding to England's already burgeoning excellence in many of the other overloaded positions. And we should not forget that a few of England's best players were not available for this international break.\nLet's look at right-wing first, and the breakthrough performances of Noni Madueke.\nHe scored his first international goal in Belgrade (and what a goal it was) and was England's biggest threat in both World Cup qualifiers.\n\nBut…when England get to the World Cup finals and their opening group game, is he really going to start ahead of Bukayo Saka, who has been one of England's most impressive performers in the last three major tournaments?\nTuchel may well be helped out by Mikel Arteta in this regard, who has exactly the same conundrum to solve in the Premier League at Arsenal.\nHow and where do you accommodate Madueke, if you assume that Saka will start every big game, when fit?\nMadueke has done enough in this international break for us to assume he will be included in the 26 for next summer's tournament - but the brutal reality may be that, assuming everyone is fit, he may have to settle for a role as an impact substitute - or switch sides. Jarrod Bowen, Morgan Rogers and even Cole Palmer offer alternatives on the right flank.\nIt's time for a reality check: if he's fit, Jude Bellingham is, and will always be, England's first choice No 10.\nHe is a generational talent, and anyone else who has hopes playing that role, will play second fiddle.\nThat includes Palmer, who is an extraordinary footballer in his own right, and Phil Foden, who is out of form, but has been a key player for England for a long time now.\n\nThat's tough for Eberechi Eze and Rogers, who have filled that role in this international break, with the other three missing.\nEze struggled to make an impact, in truth, in the congested central areas of Villa Park, and his move to Arsenal has denied him some much-needed Premier League game time too, so he is a bit rusty.\nRogers offered some special moments against Serbia - not least his sublime flick, which earned him an assist for Madueke's goal. His versatility may help him, as too Eze, but the Arsenal forward's best opportunity for his country may lie on the left-wing.\nTuchel's options on the left are more difficult to call right now. It looks likely that both Madueke and Eze will be given the chance to impress here in the games to come between now and next summer.\nBut it's clear that Tuchel has a lot of love for Marcus Rashford, who was included in this squad despite an indifferent start for Barcelona. By contrast, Trent Alexander-Arnold, who's facing similar challenges since his move to LaLiga, was left out, and that's a notable difference between the two players.\nTuchel phoned Rashford when he first got the England manager's job and told him how important he is for England's prospects. The German wants an excuse to pick and play Rashford, so if the Manchester United loanee is playing and performing for Barcelona, you suspect he will be first pick. Anthony Gordon did well in Belgrade and reinforced the perception that he is a good option when England need more defensive work-rate from their wingers.\nIt went largely unnoticed that, after the stilted 2-0 win over Andorra, Tuchel was talking about his No 9 options and he completely ignored Liam Delap, Ivan Toney and Dominic Solanke - two of whom (Toney and Solanke) have been called up on his watch, but were left sitting on the bench throughout.\nWhen asked about his striker options beyond Harry Kane and Ollie Watkins, it was striking that Tuchel mentioned Rashford, Gordon and even Foden (who was dropped for this camp) as options at No 9 - with no mention at all of Delap, Toney and Solanke.\nThat leads to the natural assumption that Tuchel will only take Kane and Watkins to the World Cup as out-and-out No 9s, and if he needs someone else up top, he will use a false nine rather than Delap, Solanke or Toney.\n\nSuddenly, it looks to be a battle for Trent Alexander-Arnold to make the World Cup squad.\nTuchel has said Reece James is his first-choice right-back, and that's fair on the evidence of his recent performances for club and country.\n\nHe's the best combination of attacking prowess (with his brilliant crossing) and defensive nous. Myles Lewis-Skelly seems to be Tuchel's first choice at left-back (look at the fact he started against Andorra, despite not doing so for Arsenal yet this season, and was only left out of the Serbia game because the FA physios felt it was too much to load him with two full games in three days).\nTino Livramento now looks to have a really strong chance of being on the plane next summer, with his versatility to play on either flank a real plus. Then that would mean there is space for one more full-back in the squad of 26 - with Trent and Djed Spence in the mix, and maybe Kyle Walker, Ben White and Lewis Hall waiting in the wings.\nTuchel likes to split his central-defensive options between those players who prefer playing on the left and those who favour the right.\nIn this camp, it was Dan Burn and Marc Guehi for the former, Ezri Konsa and Jarell Quansah for the latter. Quansah, a late call-up, didn't get a minute of football.\nTuchel is adamant he won't give players minutes out of charity or a sense of obligation. He doesn't do that. So Konsa, Guehi and Burn look to have strong claims for a spot in the World Cup squad - with John Stones as another shoo-in, if he can stay fit and have a run of games.\nTuchel said, when Stones withdrew from the squad ahead of the Andorra game: \"I hope he keeps his spirit up because he will stay important for us.\"\nThe former Chelsea boss summoned him to join the squad in Barcelona in June, even though the Manchester City man was injured.\n\"I saw… what he means to the group as a personality and as a social glue within the group. What he brings to the pitch is outstanding quality.\"\nBut the facts of the matter are that injury has robbed Stones of the last three England camps. He has yet to play a single minute of football for the new manager, and so Tuchel has to think about plan Bs.\nTrevoh Chalobah and possibly even Harry Maguire could yet come into the mix.",

        "title": "Premier League predictions and best bets: Will Liverpool's stodgy performances come to bite them at Burnley?",
        "content": "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back to preview Super Sunday as Liverpool travel to Burnley and Man City host Man Utd.\nThese newly-promoted teams at home are going to be bigger forces to be reckoned with than last season. Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester only won five home games between them while the new boys are already at four wins combined from just five matches.\nBurnley at Turf Moor can make this scrappy and fiddly for Liverpool. Scott Parker's team are unbeaten in their last 24 home league games and although that run is likely to end here, there will be positive vibes with the players likely to feed off the fact they're very used to winning games in front of their own supporters.\nDespite Liverpool's perfect start results-wise, it has been clear they've struggled to find their flow and that stodge may just continue for another week due to the international break limiting time on the training pitch for Arne Slot. The Reds beat Leicester, Wolves and Southampton twice across all competitions by a one-goal margin last season on the road. It's 11/4 with Sky Bet to happen again at Turf Moor.\nThe Premier League might be back on your screen, and you're ready to go goals galore with your punting after sitting through England vs Andorra for the 32,000th time but the trends suggest this is a time in the calendar where goals drop like a stone.\nPlayers have been flying halfway across the globe and managers have had barely a day or two with their full squads.\nThe result? Slower starts, lower intensity, fewer chances.\nAcross the last two seasons, this matchday immediately after the international break, the average goals per game sits at a lowly 2.35 which is way down on the overall average of 3.1 per game during those two seasons.\nAlso, of the last 40 Premier League games played immediately after the first international break, 20 of them have been 0-0 at the break and the average first half goals scored is 0.9 per game.\nMatches can be cagey and this one fits the bill where the market is overplaying the chances of goals. That makes the under 2.5 line at 13/8 with Sky Bet a nice edge to attack in a fixture which has only averaged 2.6 goals per game across the last 10.\n",

        "title": "Alexander Isak: Liverpool boss Arne Slot confirms new signing available to make debut against Atletico Madrid",
        "content": "Liverpool boss Arne Slot has confirmed Alexander Isak is available to make his debut in the Reds' Champions League opener against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday - but the striker will not play the full game.\nIsak is yet to make an appearance for Liverpool since joining on Deadline Day in a £125m British-record deal.\nThe Sweden international was left out of Sunday's win at Burnley, but he could make his long-awaited debut at Anfield either from the start or off the bench.\nAsked about Isak's chance of playing against Atletico, Slot said: \"There is definitely a chance because he is in the squad.\n\"Then there's a chance to play, but I can say it's 100 per cent sure that he will not play 90 minutes. But he's part of the squad.\n\"It's already a Champions League game to look forward to, but if people look forward to his playing time, that could mean that could happen as well.\"\nQuestioned on whether Isak will start, Slot replied: \"The only thing that is sure is that he will not play 90 and all the rest you will see.\"\n\nIsak missed pre-season and game time due to his dispute with Newcastle before sealing his move to Liverpool, and he has only played 18 minutes of football this season for Sweden.\nAsked what Isak's biggest challenge is, Slot responded: \"Getting fit after missing out on four months of proper team sessions.\n\"He doesn't have to prove to anyone that he's good enough to play in the Premier League because that's what he's proven already at Newcastle.\n\"The main challenge he has is to become so fit that he is first of all ready to do what he did last season.\"\nHe added: \"The moment he's fit, match fit, and he can play 90, then the next step is playing three times in a week, then the next step is going one step further in terms of pressing. Then scoring goals and doing special things in attack, that is something he will 100 per cent sure do.\"\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes Isak, who scored 54 times in 86 Premier League appearances for Newcastle, is the \"complete striker\".\n\"He's a clinical finisher,\" he said. \"You look at his finishing skills - heading, left, right, top corners - he is the complete striker at the moment.\n\"You can say the same for Hugo [Ekitike]. They are maybe a little bit different, but not as much.\n\"They both have so much quality. They are very comfortable on the ball so they can link up play. They have pace, and that's what is being asked of the modern-day striker.\n\"Both are a handful, and that's good that they are on my side now. So hopefully, they can show that to the opponent in the next year.\"\nVan Dijk, however, is aware that the British-record £125m fee paid for Isak will \"create pressure\" for the 25-year-old.\nThe Dutchman said: \"It's not really an addition is it? It's a replacement because players with a lot of quality left us, so we had to replace these players who were so important for us and we had success with.\n\"It comes with the price tag, and the price tag we have no control over. I totally understand from the outside world that there'll always be talk about that, and that creates a sort of pressure. But it's down to him and with us that we don't speak about those type of things.\n\"Hopefully for him, he can score a lot of goals. Just work hard, enjoy being the number nine for Liverpool, be important for the group with goals, assists, link-up play, help others and that's the only thing you have influence on.\"\nVan Dijk also echoed his head coach's calls for Isak to get match fit.\nAsked about his first impressions of Isak, he replied: \"Very good. Very eager. The quality he's been showing already since the first session - I was still on international [duty] - from what I've heard and seen, so only positive.\n\"Off the pitch as well, we have conversations. I spoke to him during the international break when everything was sorted.\n\"For him, it's about getting as fit as possible as quickly as possible, getting to understand each one of us as quickly as possible, how we train, how we press, set-pieces.\n\"It's been a good week for him - let's see.\"",

        "title": "Arsenal vs Man City: Mikel Arteta has selection dilemma involving Declan Rice and Mikel Merino ahead of crucial Premier League game",
        "content": "Once again, the talk is all about Arsenal's depth. Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard rescued the game off the bench in Bilbao to not only highlight how strong the Gunners are going forward, but also how far their squad has come from last season.\nBut a more pertinent question regarding the double super sub move from Mikel Arteta is: why were they needed in the first place?\nTuesday afternoon's win over Athletic was a game where Arsenal were not under any real pressure from their opponents. The Spanish side had 11 shots but only two were on target - and they were routine stops for David Raya.\nThat is once again due to Arsenal's strong defensive structure. And yet, the Gunners made hard work of their first Champions League fixture. For long periods, Arsenal lacked fluency going forward - and one obvious theme stood out once again.\nJust like against Liverpool last month, Arsenal lined up with a midfield three of Mikel Merino and Declan Rice , ahead of the defensive pivot in Martin Zubimendi. And just like against Liverpool, Arsenal were limited going forward for most of the game.\nArsenal struggling with Merino and Rice as their two No 8s is a long-running theme.\nIn the Premier League, Merino and Rice have started together in midfield in nine games. Arsenal have only won one of those matches. That was a 4-0 win away at a poor Ipswich side, with the pressure on getting a result completely off given the focus at the time was on the Champions League.\nIn the other games, the pressure was on Arsenal to get a result but they lacked creativity. There was the 10-man defeat to Bournemouth - but the Gunners lacked fluency even before William Saliba's red card. They had one shot on target in the 1-0 defeat at Newcastle, while they only managed nine shots overall in the 1-1 draw at Brighton.\nA lot of the games saw Rice play as the defensive midfielder, with Merino further forward. But it has come apparent over the last 12 months that both are very similar players - who want to make runs from deep to create space in the box and score. There are doubts as to whether both of them together in the same team works.\nThe reason why Arteta favours Merino and Rice in midfield is because of the duel-winning ability of both players. The Arsenal manager discussed the importance of that in Bilbao on Tuesday night.\n\"We knew that in the first 20 to 25 minutes it was going to be really tough, especially the way they played. It was so intense, a lot of direct players, a lot of duels,\" said Arteta in his press conference.\nBut it came at a cost, with the Gunners managing just one shot on target despite having over 65 per cent possession. That may have been part of Arteta's plan - to keep things tight in the first hour then use their bench to win the game - but that was the same ploy against Liverpool at Anfield.\nAnd with Manchester City up next at the Emirates, live on Sky Sports this Sunday, the margins will be equally tight compared to Anfield. How Arteta deploys his midfield is a key talking point about not only Arsenal's chances of winning, but also their mindset going into it.\nA lot will depend on the fitness of Martin Odegaard . But if his shoulder injury does not heal in time for the City game, as it did for the Liverpool game where he could only make the bench, Arteta has a decision to make.\nDoes he go with that same midfield against Athletic, which gained a lot of criticism when Arsenal used that same set-up against Liverpool and lost by not having enough attacking verve?\nOr, with the Emirates set to be rocking amid the recent needle between the two sides, does he put a more attacking player in there?\n\nIt was a surprise to see Ethan Nwaneri not feature against Athletic, for example, especially after the 18-year-old filled Odegaard's shoes so well against Leeds and Nottingham Forest.\nAfter the 3-0 win over Forest, Arteta hailed Nwaneri's display, but the fact the Arsenal manager did not give the teenager a start in the context of an intense Bilbao battle shows there is not a complete level of trust in the academy product for the biggest of responsibilities.\nAnother option for Arteta is to move Eberechi Eze into Odegaard's attacking midfield role. Eze has so far featured for Arsenal as a left winger, but his more natural role is that No 10 position.\nThat was evident in one moment in the first half against Athletic, where Eze drifted inside off the wing and received an earful from Arteta, who wanted him hugging the touchline.\nBut if Eze comes inside, then his left wing spot would need to be filled. Noni Madueke would be an option for that left wing spot if Bukayo Saka makes it back in time for that fixture. But like Odegaard, the latter's fitness battle is not guaranteed to fall in Arsenal's favour.\nThat would present Martinelli and Trossard the chance to start against City, but have they showed they are better as impact substitutes - or 'finishers', as Arteta describes them.\nMartinelli took just 35 seconds to show how useful his pace could be off the bench - against a tired defence in a tight and stretched match - where the margins are minimal.\nAnd there is also a feeling that Trossard is much better as an impact player for Arsenal. That has been noticed across the last 12 months, but also in the last few days - he has a goal and two assists in his last two substitute appearances.\n\"They are at least equally important, or more important,\" said Arteta about all of his substitutes after the win in Bilbao.\n\"We have discussed that the 'finishers' are going to be more important this season, sometimes more than the starters. We can change the game there.\"\nThese are not the the only selection dilemmas Arteta has. Does he go with the in-form Riccardo Calafiori or Myles Lewis-Skelly, who scored in the last meeting against City? What does he do with Cristhian Mosquera , who has not put a foot wrong since coming in for the injured Saliba, who is available again?\nIt adds to the feeling that Arsenal are stronger this season. But games like Man City at the Emirates on Sunday are where seasons could be decided. Arsenal cannot afford to drop points and allow Liverpool to create a lead at the top of the table - or they will be in the same catch-up position as last year.\nArteta describes these big occasions as an \"opportunity\" for his team - and it is for him as well regarding his team selection, plus how he uses his midfield and wide areas.\nThis is a chance to prove that Arsenal are not a defensive-minded, risk-averse team in these big games, like at Anfield, but they have enough offensive wizardry to make a big statement about their mindset this season.\nWatch Arsenal vs Man City live on Sky Sports this Sunday, kick-off 4.30pm",

        "content": "Manchester United achieved record revenues for 2024/25 of £666.5m - but the club still made an overall loss of £33m.\nThe club's annual accounts showed that they earned greater revenue than ever before despite not having Champions League football last season, in which they finished 15th in the Premier League - their lowest top-flight finish in 51 years.\nUnited still saw revenue marginally increase by 0.7 per cent to £666.5m, with the accounts for the year ending June 30, 2025 showing their operating loss fell from £69.3m to £18.4m compared to the previous 12 months.\nUnited bosses have hailed their five-year shirt sponsorship with Snapdragon as the most valuable of its kind in world sport, and that played a significant role in boosting revenues with four years remaining on that deal.\nUnited posted record commercial revenues of £333.3m while achieving record matchday revenues of £160.3m.\nOverall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw a raft of cost-cutting measures.\nThe accounts show total operating expenses were £733.6m, a decrease of £34.9m, or 4.5%, and employee expenses by 14.1 per cent, or £51.5m, to £313.2m.\nThis was achieved by several high-earning players, who were not part of the first-team plans, going out on loan or being sold, and wider club restructuring. More than 250 members of staff at Old Trafford were made redundant in the first round of cuts.\nThe club said they spent £36.6m in terms of exceptional items, which included pay-offs to employees as part of their \"transformation plan\" along with former boss Erik ten Hag and his staff.\nThe results released on Wednesday showed broadcasting revenue for the 12 months ending June 30, 2025 decreased by £48.9m to £172.9m after the men's team played in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.\nMore cost-cutting and difficult decisions are expected as INEOS completes its restructuring of the football club.\nRatcliffe warned United would have gone \"bust at Christmas\" if they had not taken \"really tough decisions\" - something chief executive Omar Berrada believes will help moving forwards.\n\"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas,\" he said.\n\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term.\n\"Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.\n\n\"To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United.\n\"Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners.\n\"As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"\nUnited are expecting the next financial year to bring in revenue of £640m to £660m despite being without European football for the first time since 2014/15.\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett:\n\"The Manchester United bosses will be pleased with these figures, which they will feel show real progress towards cutting costs and growing revenues. But theirs is a long-term plan to rejuvenate and regenerate the club, and while record revenues show that the club still has a huge commercial pull as one of the biggest in world football, fans shouldn't think that will mean bumper spending in the January window, or next summer.\n\"There is still much more work to do to sort out the finances, which will mean more tough decisions and compromises going forward, as United strive to once again be a force at the top end of the Premier League table.\n\"Deloitte said in January that United was the fourth biggest club in the world, only behind Real Madrid, Manchester City and PSG in terms of revenue. These latest figures will show that they have maintained that strong position, despite their worst performance on the pitch since 1974, when the club was relegated. A lack of Champions League football and a 15th-placed finish in the league cost them tens of millions of pounds.\n\"But the chief executive's statement has made the strategy clear: make United more and more commercially successful, and in future, there will be more and more funds to invest in the football squad, which they hope and believe will then lead to better results on the pitch, and a return to the days when they won trophies.\n\"We should not forget the underlying financial problems that United have, however, been brought about by the Glazer family takeover in the early 2000s.\n\"That 'leveraged buy-out' effectively lumped £790m of debt onto the club, which the Glazers used to buy a controlling stake at Old Trafford.\n\"These latest figures show that debt has reduced somewhat (by around £39m to £471.9m), but that reduction is because of a change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, rather than any of the debt being specifically paid off.\n\"In addition, the \"revolving credit facility\" that the club has (in effect, like a personal credit card) now has £165.1m of additional debt on it - up from £35.6m last year.\n\"While the record revenues and reduced losses are no doubt a sign that United are making impressive commercial strides off the pitch, the Glazer debt and the continued under-performance of the team on the pitch are two nagging negatives.\"",

        "title": "Kris Boyd: Rangers should appoint Sean Dyche if Russell Martin is sacked to end toxicity around club",
        "content": "The board decided to appoint Russell Martin in the summer, and they're going to back him for as long as they possibly can. But when you look at the fans' reaction over the last few weeks, it's reached a tipping point with them, and I don't see any way back for Martin right now.\nYou're now looking at a situation where it's going to turn on Chief Executive Officer Patrick Stewart and Sporting Director Kevin Thelwell.\nI was at Ibrox on Saturday - it was toxic. But for me, listening to a lot of the Rangers fans, they feel as if the time is already up for Martin.\n\nThere are protests on Saturday against Stewart, and it will turn on Thelwell soon as well, so the Rangers fans have definitely had enough.\nWhen you bring a new manager in, you would expect at least a little bounce, and that's what's happened when the last few have arrived at Ibrox, then it's frittered away and there's not been anything to back it up over a period of time.\nMartin has failed to get a reaction out of the group and also brought in a lot of new players and failed. So right now, it's not looking good.\nI can't see a way back now for Martin. I have never, ever heard a football stadium like it was on Saturday. The fans have had enough.\nFor them, I think they've already washed their hands with Martin. It will, and it is going to turn on the board now, and they have got huge decisions to make.\nI don't think that Stewart has ever been a favourite of the Rangers fans, and they're going to turn on him now as well.\nWhen you look at the damage that's being done on the pitch, but also behind the scenes as well.\nEvery time I speak to somebody, I hear somebody else is leaving the day-to-day staff. So all is not rosy, not only on the pitch, but off it as well, and something's going to have to give.\nSteven Gerrard's a name that's never gone away.\nFrank Lampard's name was another one that was mentioned. I know he's doing some wonderful things at Coventry City, but is that out of the equation now?\nThe obvious one for me would be Sean Dyche. Kevin Thelwell worked with him in the past, and he seems to have a lot of say in the players that are coming in.\nSo if that relationship with Dyche is still there, he would be someone that I would maybe look to because he's shown that he can build football clubs up. And right now, Rangers need a strong character that's going to build it not only on the pitch, but off the pitch at the training centre.\nIt just seems to be so broken, disjointed, and they're going to have to find a way to fix it.\n\nI think there is something bigger at play here. You take the bench on Saturday, there was over £25m worth of players talent on that bench.\nWhen you're signing Youssef Chermiti for £10m and Oliver Antman for £4m - these guys have got to be playing.\nYou're bringing in players like Emmanuel Fernandez for £3.5m as a development player, but we keep hearing development and a project at Rangers. It's never going to be that. Rangers have to win, and that's not been the case for a number of years.\nIf the hierarchy believes that there's going to be a period of time where they can go and not win games of football to allow someone to bed things in and improve players, it's not going to happen. You need to win.\nI think the recruitment strikes to me as if Rangers have tried to hit the jackpot with every signing by bringing in youngsters, hopefully they'll do well, and then try and sell them on and run it like that. That can't be the case either.\nYou look at any successful business, whether it's on the pitch or it's off the pitch, you've got people that are still going to turn up the following year because they won't leave, know the football club and are there on a daily basis.\nCeltic have got that in abundance through the spine of their team, like Callum McGregor.\nRangers have so much upheaval all the time. The model right now seems to be broken, and they're going to have to fix it very soon because it is not a pleasant place to be or play football right now.\nRangers is a very difficult environment. You need strong characters. It's a great place when you're winning, but when you're not, it's a very difficult place and I'm not sure that Rangers have the right characters throughout the club to deal with the pressure that's going to come.",

        "content": "We are only four games into the Premier League season, but West Ham's match against Crystal Palace on Saturday could be a crucial one for Graham Potter.\nDerby defeats to Chelsea and Tottenham will never go down well in east London, especially at home, but they will be accepted if the supporters see their team in the game.\nOnce Chelsea went 2-1 up, and after the second-half whistle went against Tottenham, West Ham collapsed. The 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland was the same after the first goal was conceded.\nThere's no suggestion, at the moment, that this is a must-win game for Potter. But a similar defeat to Crystal Palace at the London Stadium on Saturday will be hard for him to come back from. The pressure is building.\nWest Ham's next two opponents, Palace and Everton, are painful examples for their fans of what they had, and what they could've had.\n\nThe Eagles still play in their sacred home of Selhurst Park, with fans on top of the pitch just like at the old Boleyn Ground, and they were specifically mentioned in the recent Fan Advisory Board letter to the club as a team looked at with envy.\nAnd Everton have gone the other way, moving to a purpose-built football stadium, where fans already seem at home.\nPotter can't change the stadium that West Ham play in, but he is the one responsible for how they play there. He needs at least a performance against Palace.\nWest Ham do not like sacking managers. And vice-chair Baroness Karen Brady has publicly backed Potter.\nThe manager will look to the 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest and see a similar level of opposition in Palace and Everton, where results could turn the noise down.\nBut currently, West Ham are ranking 19th on recoveries made and have conceded the most goals from set pieces in the Premier League, with all six arriving from corners.\nFans don't need the numbers to tell you these are areas West Ham need to improve.\nFor Potter, since he arrived, it's eleven home games in the league, two wins. Eleven away games in the league, four wins.\nNow is the time to turn things around.",

        "title": "Ange Postecoglou: Nottingham Forest head coach under pressure with trip to Newcastle crucial",
        "content": "Pressure is mounting on Ange Postecoglou less than a month into his new role at Nottingham Forest and Sky Sports News has been told owner Evangelos Marinakis will not hesitate in removing the head coach if performances and results do not quickly improve.\nPostecoglou has failed to win any of his first six matches in charge and it is clear another defeat and poor performance at Newcastle on Sunday - live on Sky Sports - could be crucial in seeing the current levels of patience wane within the Forest boardroom.\nThe international break could be vital for the 60-year-old's future, especially considering he was brought in to replace Nuno Espirito Santo during the previous one in September.\nHowever, Postecoglou retains the immediate support of the club's hierarchy, who only want to focus on the pivotal game at St James' Park.\nSome Forest supporters chanted for Postecoglou to be sacked during the Europa League defeat to Midtjylland on Thursday - his fourth defeat since replacing Nuno, who was sacked after falling out with Marinakis.\nIt is thought there is anger among the Forest hierarchy at the performance of referee Willy Delajod against Midtjylland and that has provided some mitigation in their assessment of how the team - and the head coach - performed.\nBut defeat on Sunday would make Postecoglou the first permanent head coach since 1960 to fail to win any of his first four league games at the club.\n\nPostecoglou is in a personal Premier League rut - he is winless in his last 10 games, taking into consideration his last seven matches at Tottenham before he was sacked at the end of last season.\nIf he were to leave during the international break, it is likely to break Alex McLeish's 40-day tenure as Forest boss back in 2012, and Sam Allardyce's record of 30 days at Leeds as the shortest Premier League reign.\n\nPostecoglou admitted earlier on Friday he cannot afford to \"worry about what is going to happen next week\", instead focusing on trying to get his side out of its bad run of form.\n\"I get it [speculation about his future] and it is a valid assumption in modern football,\" he said. \"There is always a manager under pressure but I do not think that way.\n\"Put it this way, I knew I was getting sacked at Tottenham about three of four months before I did and it did not stop me winning something.\n\"It [pressure] does not enter my head. My responsibility lies in making sure this club progresses and gets to a position where it can challenge for things. If I start putting timelines to that, to start worrying about what is going to happen next week, then I am not going to be performing the role I was given and I just do not think it is helpful to anyone.\n\"At the end of the day, the things I control are the environment, the training, the way we play and, as I said last night, I am still very strong in my belief that we are not too far away.\"\nJamie Redknapp on Sky Sports' Premier League Show:\n\"It's a bit crazy. He's six games into his tenure. If it's six months and they're still performing like this and in a bad run, then I get it because that's just the way football is. But six games doesn't sit right with me.\n\n\"At the end of last season, Nottingham Forest were really struggling. They were in a great position to get top four, but they finished poorly and they've started poorly [this season].\n\"When you try and bring in a different philosophy with a different manager... whatever you think about Nuno, they won games 1-0 and were difficult to beat, they sat back and counter-attacked brilliantly with pace on the break, and Chris Wood was in a purple patch.\n\"This season, they are going to change and he will want to play a different style of football, and that will take time.\n\"Every day in training, different sessions, getting used to it and more forward-thinking. His philosophy is completely different to Nuno's.\n\"You have to give the players time to adapt and definitely more than six games. That doesn't make sense to me.\"",

        "content": "Ruben Amorim said he has no plans to walk away from the Manchester United job and insisted his system is not to blame for their struggles in an impassioned press conference.\nHIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.\nSky Sports pundit Gary Neville said this week he is \"very worried\" about Amorim's performance, while Jamie Carragher described the 40-year-old's tenure as a \"disaster\" which \"has to end\".\nAhead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.\n\nAMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.\n\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.\n\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.\n\"I'm telling you when we finish the game and you can see me, I don't care about my job. That hurt of not winning games or failing. That is the thing that hurts me the most.\"\nAMORIM: \"That is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard. It's so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, and something happens.\n\n\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.\n\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"\nAMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.\n\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.\n\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.\n\n\"I see a lot of things that my wife is talking with the media. That is such nonsense.\n\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.\n\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"\nAMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.\n\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.\n\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.\n\"So my biggest problem is [if] my players believe in you guys when they say the problem of our team is the system.\n\"I get crazy about that because I can see the team, I see this team playing in a different system.\n\"We need to play the same way with the same power with the same intensity with the same focus. If you do that, the system doesn't matter.\"\nAMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.\n\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"\n\nAMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.\n\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.\n\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.\n\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.\n\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.\n\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"\nAMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.\n\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.\n\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.\n\n\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.\n\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.\n\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.\n\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",

        "title": "Vitor Pereira interview: Wolves coach says summer signings need time but they will turn Premier League season around",
        "content": "Wolves gambled this summer bringing in six players new to the Premier League. So far, that gamble has not paid off. Vitor Pereira thinks they just need time. “Without time, it is like buying a lottery ticket,” he tells Sky Sports . “You don’t know what will happen.”\nHaving seen standout performers Matheus Cunha, Rayan Ait Nouri and Nelson Semedo depart, Wolves invested north of £100m on new players. They recruited them from Celta Vigo and Girona, from AZ Alkmaar and Genk, from Hellas Verona and Fluminense.\nBut five consecutive defeats underlined the point that the Premier League is not prepared to wait for players. Tottenham's late equaliser last time out means they are still waiting for their first win in the competition this season and sit bottom of the table.\n\nPereira is uncomfortable there, as you might expect. A title winner in Portugal, Greece and China, this is not his natural altitude. \"I am not used to being in this position,\" he concedes. But the message from Pereira is that he believes in himself and, importantly, his players.\n\"It is the first time in my career that I am in this position but I am very resilient,\" he says, speaking at the club's training ground. \"I have a lot of confidence in myself, in my staff, in our work. And I have a lot of confidence in the players, in the club and in the supporters.\"\nThose fans are certainly backing him. Pereira's name has been chanted at every game this season and his team were applauded off twice last week. His catchphrase - 'first the points then the pints' - may leave him thirsty right now but his popularity endures.\nThough he himself denies it, the feeling remains that Pereira saved Wolves last season, taking over a rudderless team in the relegation zone and going on to win six games in a row at one stage. It earned him a nomination as the Premier League manager of the season.\n\"This is a strong connection,\" he says of the fans. \"In this city. I feel like I am with my family. The people take care of me. If I go in a pub, if I go somewhere, the people try to show that I am one of them. This is something special. That is why I feel like I am working for my family.\"\nWhile that connection remains, the fans' relationship with those above him is more strained and many are still to be convinced by some of the summer signings. Jhon Arias, the Colombian winger, did win player of the match at Spurs after a slow start in England.\nThe versatile Czech Ladislav Krejci was named the club's player of the month for September. But while Fer Lopez, the 20-year-old Spanish winger, did assist Krejci's goal against Leeds, that remains his only Premier League start and he was substituted at half-time.\nJackson Tchatchoua and Tolu Arokodare were on the bench at Spurs. David Moller Wolfe has not played a minute in their last four matches. Pereira acknowledges all of this but sets out to explain. \"The players arrived at the club very late, in my opinion,\" he says.\n\"We have players with different concepts because we bought players from different leagues, with different mentalities, different cultures. If you have time with them, you can put them on the same page, go in the same direction, tactically and mentally.\n\"Even the communication when you bring in players from other leagues who don't know the language. Now, I am realising that they understand what we are asking. They are starting to enjoy training, enjoy the games. Now, I see the connections between them.\n\"Imagine Arias. He arrives here in the Premier League, different league, different language. In Brazil, the game is different. After many years in Brazil, he felt very comfortable playing in the same system, the same club. He felt confident to express himself.\n\"The relationship with the team-mates, the new club, there are a lot of things before the player feels comfortable knowing tactically what the manager wants, what the players are thinking when they have the ball, the movements that they will do to open space.\"\nPereira admits that he is still learning about them. \"I need to understand what each one can give me in the system. For example, my expectation might be that this player, with these skills, can play inside, between the lines, or outside, coming inside with the ball.\n\"Then, when we start to work with them, we might realise they are a player who feels more comfortable between the lines but not on the outside. Or the opposite and they like to receive it on the outside. This is the knowledge that we need to have.\"\nBut he feels a corner has been turned. \"We have worked together for two weeks. It is a start. Now I am having good feelings because now I think we can compete. Now we are building, now we are start to see a team that can compete,\" he argues, leaning forward purposefully.\n\"They will become better. They will be in condition to show why we bought them. But they need this time. It is not easy. This is the time that we need. We cannot do magic. But I believe in this team because we have the character, the courage and the quality.\"\nPereira even suggests Wolves could be stronger for it. At Spurs, Thomas Frank admitted to being surprised by the formation changes, Pereira's team starting with four at the back before switching to three. \"Last season, it was not possible to work two systems.\"\nWith the impressive Krejci capable of playing in defence or midfield, Wolves can now make that change without even needing to turn to their bench. \"He gives us a lot because he is technically a very good player and he understands the game very well.\"\nHe adds: \"Now, I think it is possible to play with three or four. We can manage both systems. For us, it is important because we can surprise the opponent.\" Crucial, he thinks, in a Premier League that demands so much tactically, technically and physically.\nWill it be enough? Outside the club, the verdict is in. Wolves are the bookmakers' favourites for relegation following their poor start. Within the club, Pereira has been rewarded for his work with a new contract. He is convincing. Can he convince his team?\n\"I think a manager is also a teacher,\" he says. Handily, Pereira, 57, spent 15 years as a teacher before his coaching career. \"Not only to teach about tactical things but mentally we need to sell ideas. Tactically and mentally to sell ideas and make players believe.\"\nHe is trying to infuse those players with the confidence needed. \"I can try to explain when I feel confident. I feel confident when I start to control things, when I start to see what we want on the pitch.\" That is happening now, he insists. Better times are ahead.\n\"I will work hard, the hours that I need, to increase the level of this team, to see again the happiness in the faces of the supporters. I know the supporters. When we start to win games, they will be the energy that we need to turn around this situation,\" he says.\n\"And we will do it for sure. Together.\"\nWatch Wolves vs Brighton live on Sky Sports Mix this Sunday from 12.30pm; kick-off 2pm",

        "title": "Premier League predictions and best bets: Newcastle to push Ange Postecoglou to the exit door?",
        "content": "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and tips more misery for Ange Postecoglou.\nBurnley's new signing, Florentino, is shaping up as a fantastic bet in the fouls committed markets, which are often overlooked as a mainstream betting medium but are laced with value especially for new signings adapting to the Premier League's physical demands.\nThe Premier League is fast, physical and ruthless and Florentino's style screams dynamic enforcer on what we've seen from him in his two starts so far. He's a midfielder who plays with aggression and intensity, breaking up play and never shying away from a physical duel.\nThe former Benfica man committed 1.79 fouls per 90 last season, including making at least one foul in his last 19 starts. He's already made three in two starts for Burnley and such is Villa's foul-drawing strength in central areas, that kind of average is likely to be repeated at Villa Park. The Evens for two or more Florentino fouls looks a solid play.\nCrystal Palace have the team to do something really special this season in the Premier League.\nBut they won't.\nAs to remain consistent in the Premier League will be almost impossible for them to achieve due to their European commitments.\nA first taste of European football in their modern era is something fans and Oliver Glasner will take very seriously. And rightly so. Selhurst Park under the lights for a knockout game will be mega. But as romantic as that sounds, it's also going to bring with it a Premier League hangover.\nClubs of Palace's stature and budget often struggle to handle the double life of domestic and European football. Clubs outside the big six who get Europe have an average drop of 6.3 league positions the following season since 2015. We've seen it with Brighton, West Ham and Leicester over the years. It's going to happen to Palace, so the home win at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks a wise investment on Everton following Palace's midweek trip to Poland.\nIn a Newcastle midfield built to fight, Sandro Tonali glides and creates the magic. While Bruno Guimaraes orchestrates and Joelinton bullies, Tonali is the biggest goal threat. Everything he does is filled with intent. He doesn't just want to circulate possession. He wants to influence.\nWhen Newcastle play at home, Eddie Howe unleashes a more expansive, front-foot midfield. Tonali becomes the spare man in transitions, the third runner in attacks and has become a goal threat. He's scored five times in his last 17 starts at St James' Park and has averaged a healthy 1.62 shots per 90 with hitting two or more shots in seven of his last 11 home starts.\nHe's not being priced like a consistent goalscoring threat yet. And that's where the edge is at 11/2 with Sky Bet.\nBrighton at odds-on to beat Wolves? It just doesn't sit right. The price doesn't match the flakiness and inconsistencies involved with Fabian Hurzeler's team.\nYes, Brighton are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are.\nBrighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.6 expected goals per game over the last 13 Premier League - that's the worst per 90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.\nTheir pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games, too.\nWolves are of course no juggernaut, but they're tactically disciplined, aggressive in duels and more than capable of spoiling Brighton's rhythm in midfield.\nThe market is pricing up Brighton on vibes rather than reality. Back Wolves on the draw no bet at 7/4 with Sky Bet.\nThere are few greater joys in the betting game than sniffing out value in the foul markets. It's the new frontier. Goalscorer markets are overcooked. Booking points can be a lottery. Outright markets can be settled on fine margins. But fouls? That's where the true edge lives.\nThe standout match-up for fouls this weekend is Michael Kayode vs Jeremy Doku. Such is Doku's form right now, all I can say to Kayode is: good luck, son.\nKayode is as raw as they come but very aggressive with his defending, meaning he's foul-prone when isolated.\nDouk doesn't just beat defenders, he destroys them. He's drawn 13 fouls in his last five starts and is completing nearly five dribbles completed per game. Kayode is 6/4 to make two or more fouls with Sky Bet. That's a lovely angle to attack.",

        "title": "Senne Lammens keeps clean sheet on Manchester United debut as Mohammed Kudus shows worth for Tottenham - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "Senne Lammens kept a clean sheet on his Manchester United debut to help ease some of the pressure on his boss Ruben Amorim. Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko scored the goals in United's 2-0 win over Sunderland but the crowd enjoyed the goalkeeper's display.\nLammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.\nHow United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.\nThere was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Bertrand Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Bruno Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him. Adam Bate\n\nMikel Arteta described Jurrien Timber as a \"total player\" after news emerged that Arsenal were trying to tie him to a new contract this week. \"He has almost every quality that you want from a defender,\" he said. He is growing in an offensive sense too.\nThe 24-year-old, who scored two goals and set up another in the 5-0 win over Leeds earlier this season, produced another outstanding attacking display against West Ham on Saturday, his efforts rewarded when he won the penalty for the second goal.\nThat burst into the box, when he was brought down by Malik Diouf following a brilliant touch on the turn to control a high ball, was one of numerous dangerous moments. He had as many touches in the opposition box as Bukayo Saka, with six, and two shots.\nHis defensive and technical qualities have long been clear, but it previously felt like Ben White, his competition for the Arsenal right-back spot, might have an edge in the final third. Increasingly, though, it feels like Timber is offering just as much.\nThis \"total player\" is still finding ways to improve. Nick Wright\n\nLeeds will go home feeling as if they deserved more after defeat by Spurs. It is not an unfamiliar feeling. This is the third time in just seven Premier League games.\nA freak own-goal cost them a point at Fulham, a stoppage-time equaliser cost them victory against Bournemouth and this time two deflected goals cost them what could have been three points against Spurs.\n\"We've not won one point so far [being] lucky but we've lost I would say really at least six points [through being] unlucky,\" Leeds boss Daniel Farke said after the game.\nLeeds have been praised for the way they've started in their Premier League return - and would have probably taken eight points from their opening seven games before a ball was kicked - but they cannot afford to be a team defined by near-misses this season.\nAs Farke said, Leeds were better by nearly every measure against Spurs. Shots, shots on target, possession, big chances, possession, touches in the opposition box. But they lost in the only one that counts.\nFinding a way to convert these impressive performances will be crucial because there will no doubt be down moments for the newly-promoted side this season. So they need to bank as many points as they can when they are on form to give themselves the best chance of survival. Zinny Boswell\nTottenham's 2-1 win against Leeds was, without a doubt, not their finest outing. A scrappy win was secured by two deflected goals and was devoid of much quality elsewhere.\nNonetheless, in many ways, this will be more reassuring to fans than a trouncing. When the going got tough, Spurs got going - and got the result to boot.\nThomas Frank's men have had a winning mentality this season, and nowhere was this more evident than in the performance of Mohammed Kudus. The forward was at the heart of everything good for his side, and made sure he was able to provide the winning moment in the second half to a team who definitely needed one.\nKudus' winner was his first goal for the club since signing, and, alongside four assists, his fifth goal involvement this season. Only Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo (9) have more.\nHe radiates the newfound confidence of this Spurs side. The Ghanaian hasn't been rattled by having to wait until October to hit the back of the net, and took his chance well when it finally came. His head coach knows this is due to be the first of many.\n\"It's about time [Kudus scored]!\", said Frank. \"We have big expectations for him. He's been good for us - I would say our best attacking player so far this season.\n\"The mentality and character is the foundation of any great team. No matter if you play like Inter or Barcelona or whatever style of play, you need that willingness to do everything to win. I think we are building that more and more on the team.\"\nIf Nuno Espirito Santo did not know the scale of the task facing him at West Ham, he does now. It's frightening.\nAbsolutely nothing worked for him at Arsenal, with a failure to land a single shot on target not even the most glaring issue on a long list of challenges. West Ham's four points from their opening seven games is their joint-worst return at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\nBoth ends of the pitch are a problem. And the middle isn't much better either. Nuno's side conceded 21 efforts on their goal at the Emirates and four big chances - fortunately for them, Arsenal only took half. It will come as little surprise to learn they have faced more shots on target than any other side in the division (34), with a -10 goal difference also a league low.\nWhat all of that amounts to is one big headache for Nuno. \"All the aspects of the game we have to address, a lot of work on the basics,\" he admitted post-match.\nHis reign is only two games old but even he must be dispirited by what he's watching. Midway through the second period, with the scoreline only 1-0, he chose to throw Freddie Potts and Callum Marshall on, 22 and 20 respectively, despite having far more experienced options on the bench.\nPerhaps there is a difficult but important message in that. Laura Hunter\nIt's easy to talk about heart, about shape about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.\nAt some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Senne Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.\nAnd while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0 lead, the gap in quality was undeniable.\nThis was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival. Lewis Jones",

        "content": "Martin Odegaard was left with his knee in a brace and Declan Rice was forced off with a back injury as Arsenal's injury problems intensified during their 2-0 win over West Ham.\nThe Gunners went top of the Premier League thanks to Rice's opener and a Bukayo Saka penalty at the Emirates Stadium but the win came at a cost as Odegaard and Rice had to be withdrawn.\nOdegaard, who had only recently returned from a shoulder problem, lasted just half an hour, becoming the first player in Premier League history to be substituted before half-time in three consecutive starts when he was replaced by Martin Zubimendi following a collision with Crysencio Summerville.\n\"He had a clash knee-to-knee and immediately he was uncomfortable,\" said Arteta in his press conference.\n\n\"I just spoke to him and he's not positive about it. He's got a brace on. We'll have to wait and see from the doctors.\"\nArteta was similarly downbeat about Rice, who was clutching his back when he made way for Mikel Merino in the 79th minute having opened the scoring with his first goal of the campaign.\n\"He's not alright because he asked me to come off, so that's a shame,\" said Arteta.\n\"He had a pain in his back and he could not carry on, which is something very unusual for Declan, so we'll have to assess him and see how he is.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether Odegaard and Rice will be able to report for international duty with Norway and England respectively but their injuries are just the latest to affect Arsenal this season.\nThe Gunners are already without Noni Madueke , Kai Havertz , Piero Hincapie and Gabriel Jesus , while William Saliba , Bukayo Saka , Ben White and Christian Norgaard have also had spells out.\nArsenal have suffered at least one injury in all but one of their seven Premier League games so far this season.\nOdegaard's injury is particularly frustrating following impressive displays against Newcastle and Olympiakos. The 26-year-old also had to come off in previous games against Leeds and Nottingham Forest.\n\"We haven't had him since the start of the season for one reason or the other, the shoulder twice and then this injury,\" added Arteta.\n\"We have to wait and see the extent of that injury.\n\"We will find solutions but obviously our captain is at a place that gives us a completely different dimension with the things that he can do, especially in attack. Hopefully it's not that bad.\"\nArsenal resume their Premier League campaign away to Fulham, after the international break, in a game which is live on Sky Sports on Saturday October 18.",

        "title": "Gary Neville criticises 'useless' Liverpool attack as Premier League champions suffer third straight loss with Chelsea defeat",
        "content": "Gary Neville has criticised Liverpool's attack and midfield after Arne Slot's side suffered a third straight defeat in a 2-1 loss at Chelsea.\nAfter Moises Caicedo's thunderous first-half opener, Liverpool had got themselves level again in the second half through Cody Gakpo.\nHowever, Estevao's stoppage-time finish off the bench sealed a win for the home side.\nDespite hoping to complete a comeback, Neville feels that last season's champions Liverpool were extremely poor in their attempts to chase the game, especially as Chelsea suffered further injury problems in defence with Josh Acheampong and Benoit Badiashile forced off.\n\"I thought after they scored, I was really disappointed in their level of performance,\" Neville said on the Gary Neville Podcast .\n\"A lot has been made of Liverpool's defensive work and rightly so, but that's not why they've lost this game. They've lost this game because in the last 15-20 minutes, their creative players, their players in the final half of the pitch, the midfield players and the forwards were absolutely useless.\n\"They were giving the ball away like you wouldn't believe. Gakpo, Salah, the wastage. Wirtz, not knowing how to get into a game in the last 15 minutes when it was there for the taking and just sort of ended up almost marking Caicedo.\n\"I thought their front players were terrible. Salah is sublime. How can you criticise the consistency and reliability and brilliance of him, but some of the decisions of him today, when he comes inside and you think he should pass it or you think he should do something better with it, and his finishing was poor.\n\"Isak, I thought he'd started the game sharp but didn't quite get into it.\n\"Wirtz, when he came on, I was disappointed with him. He looks very immature in his knowledge of how to play the game.\n\"I just see him sort of jogging around, and I see him going too deep when he shouldn't go too deep, and I see him standing next to players when he shouldn't be standing next to players. Sometimes I see him being too honest - it sounds crazy going back and defending.\n\"He should be almost half cheating, almost like keeping an eye on that deep line midfield player just in case he can spring off him and go the other way on the counter attack. He's quite predictable at this moment in time in terms of picking up his position and he was disappointing.\n\"Liverpool were poor today. That's the most disappointing last 15 minutes I've seen from Liverpool in a long time because I think when Chelsea have that back four in play, you've scored a goal so you've got to go on and win that game.\n\n\"Everything said Liverpool should go and win that game but they've not done it and that's a problem for them.\n\"We've got a title race on. Arsenal have had a great week, Liverpool have had a poor week and I think it makes for a great next six months because it's going to be a real battle.\n\"For Liverpool they've got some work to do but they've got experienced players, they've got world-class players and individuals in their team and they've got a great manager.\n\"They'll sort it out but the full-backs have to step up, Wirtz has to start playing and understanding how he's going to sort of connect with Isak and the other forwards in the team.\"\n\nNeville's criticism extended to their backline with the former Manchester United full-back suggesting Liverpool have defensive issues too.\n\"[Milos] Kerkez looks like a youth team player,\" Neville told Sky Sports .\n\"I know he's a good player but he looks like he's playing for the U21s. He looks so naïve; he looks like a baby out there.\n\"He's losing, he's losing 50-50s against Pedro Neto. It's not as if he's coming from a different country, he's got a lot of games under his belt in the Premier League.\n\"I expected him to slot in because one, he's playing alongside Virgil van Dijk, the best centre-half in the world, so if you want to play in a back four you want to play with great defenders and he's doing that.\n\"He's got players who work hard on that side - it's not as if he's got Salah in front of him on this side which is a bit more difficult for the right back because you always get a little bit more exposed.\n\"I have to say from the first 10 minutes of that game against Bournemouth on the first day of the season on that Friday night, he struggled.\n\n\"Let's be clear, Liverpool's full-backs are struggling. Frimpong looks like he should be playing as a right winger - he doesn't perform like a right-back. Conor Bradley isn't doing it, and Andy Robertson, I think he's battling but he's not quite where he was a few years ago.\n\"Liverpool's problems I think at this moment in time as much to do with full-back as anywhere. They need to button that down.\"\nSpeaking after the game, Liverpool boss Arne Slot suggested changes over the summer have impacted his side.\n\"I think you're never close to your ideal [team],\" Slot said.\n\"You have to work really hard to reach a certain level and then it's very hard in football because you also play against very good teams to keep that level going. What I mean by that is consistency.\n\"But it's clear that we had a lot of changes in the summer. Players came in at different moments. Last week, there has hardly been any training time and still we need to try to bring these players in.\n\n\"The result would have been better today with a draw or a win, which was both possible. I don't say we deserved it, a draw we definitely deserved, then we would have had a great start to the season, if you take into account everything that happened in the summer in Liverpool.\"\n\nSky Sports' Jamie Redknapp believes Liverpool have lost their balance in their search for a winning formula after their summer transfer business.\n\"Those last-second goals end up running out, you run out of luck, and then you get caught the other side. It's become a difficult thing,\" he said.\n\"When I watched Liverpool last season, the one thing I always felt was they had control - they had a lovely balance about them, a steady back four and then Ryan Gravenberch in front.\n\"Now that manager wants him to have a slightly different role, that's fine, but you can't change too much about what was so successful. They are losing control in important matches. They are too open all the time. It's been end-to-end, that's not what Liverpool were last year.\n\"Last year, from Arne Slot, it was one of the most incredible managerial performances. To a certain extent, it all made sense; they didn't really buy any players.\n\"This year he's got different players and he's trying to fit things together quickly.\n\"Things haven't quite gelled in the way he would have liked. Alexander Isak will need time, Hugo Ekitike will need time. I thought it would all slot together perfectly but it hasn't.\"\n\nRedknapp also believes Liverpool are feeling the impact of Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure after he secured a free transfer to Real Madrid in the summer.\n\"They've got problems at full-back. They're missing Trent (Alexander-Arnold).\n\"They haven't played the same right-back since the Burnley game. (Conor) Bradley had a tough 45 minutes. (Milos) Kerkez hasn't quite adapted either - the pressure of playing for Bournemouth isn't the same.\n\"They have problems all over the pitch but especially at full-back with (Andy) Robertson's injury at the end. This international break could be a good chance to reset.\"",

I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.\"\nAmorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"\nThat view was put to Neville, who hit back.\nHe said: \"If pundits are getting into your head then you shouldn't be playing for the club.\n\"Do people not remember Alan Hanson criticising us when we broke in as young kids saying that you can't win anything with kids. That was the greatest centre-back of all time at that moment talking about us as if we were, you know, inferior and nowhere near good enough.\n\n\"Did they not think that we got criticised during our football careers. I'm sorry you're playing for Manchester United - it comes with the territory, you've got to step up.\n\"They've been hopeless in the system. If it's not the system, then the players are a problem, the manager is a problem, the whole thing's a problem if you're losing football matches to the level that they've been doing.\n\n\"I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches and I played in a dressing room that when you lost football matches you came in and you said sorry. There was accountability. Why would you blame other people. I've not got any time for excuse mentality shortcuts blaming other people - it's the worst thing that you can do in life.\n\"I think they just need to concentrate on doing their jobs and doing it well and winning football matches. The only thing that's going to shut anybody up is winning football matches and they've not won anywhere near enough.\"",

        "content": "The pressure on Gareth Taylor mounts after Liverpool fell to their fourth straight loss in the Women's Super League, beaten 1-0 by London City Lionesses.\nLiverpool are one of only two sides - along with West Ham - who remain pointless at this stage of the campaign, failing to score in three away games on the bounce for the first time since January 2020. They only managed one shot on target at Hayes Lane.\nLondon City are the latest beneficiaries of the Reds' struggles, sealing their second win of the season thanks to an 89th-minute penalty. Given four of the nine spot-kicks awarded in the WSL this term have been against London City, it was about time they were aided by one themselves.\nDefender Elena Linari smashed hers in off the crossbar after Liverpool goalkeeper Rafaela Borggrafe collided with Nikita Parris in the box. A second look might have revealed Parris' contact arrived first but the eventual outcome was no less justified.\nLondon City, who kept their first clean sheet since promotion, are up to seventh, while more misery on Merseyside means Liverpool stay second bottom, with the fewest goals of any side (one) - scored on the opening weekend.\n\nAnother of the WSL's strugglers fell to a 2-0 defeat on Sunday, with Aston Villa scoring two stunners to condemn West Ham to a seventh consecutive loss - their longest losing streak in the competition.\nThe run also represents the Hammers' worst-ever start to a WSL campaign, with no side conceding more goals (16).\nRehanne Skinner had clearly set her team up to frustrate and then hit on the break, a feat they managed for the best part of an hour, before being opened up by a fine Kirsty Hanson strike. Rachel Daly and Hanson had both squandered chances before that.\nDutch defender Lynn Wilms put the game beyond West Ham seven minutes later with a sublime free-kick from the edge of the area. No side have faced more shots than the east Londoners this term, who find themselves rock bottom with a -14 goal difference.\n\nA manager whose prospects are far more hopeful is Martin Ho, who has overseen four wins from five in his new role at Tottenham. Spurs were 1-0 victors over Brighton in their latest outing, a result which moves them third - level on points with Manchester City.\nSummer signing Cathinka Tandberg scored her third of the season after Jessica Naz's low cross from the left evaded every Brighton defender. Spurs have also registered more clean sheets (four) than any other side.\nBrighton struggled to create in the absence of Fran Kirby to knit play together, meaning the service to the front three was restricted. Rosa Kafaji and Michelle Agyemang toiled but were caught offside more times (four) than they managed efforts on target (two).\n\nNoemie Mouchon arrived late from the bench to cancel out Ornella Vignola's opener in a 1-1 draw at the King Power Stadium.\nMouchon's 81st-minute leveller was her first since recovering from an ACL injury suffered 12 months ago.\nNo team have fallen 1-0 behind in more WSL matches since the start of last season than slow starters Leicester, losing 15 of those, but their powers of recovery on this occasion earns a valiant point.",

It's fun every week. It's me this week and who knows, maybe you're all right and I'm gone. Next week it'll be somebody else and there's a lot of fun around it.\n\"I don't care. I love the position I'm in right now where I have to fight for everything. It's what I've done my whole career.\n\"I started in Australia when I was 32 years old in semi-professional football. And I'm here in the Premier League at the age of 60. Do you reckon I lack self-belief or don't like a fight? I didn't get here because of my connections.\n\"In fact, I've picked fights. I have, even in the schoolyard. I've picked fights with people who I knew would beat me up. That's the kind of person I am.\n\"I totally understand that it's part of the fanfare around the Premier League that there needs to be a manager who's always under the spotlight. I get that. It's my turn at the moment.\n\"But I think, like most other managers, I think we actually enjoy this bit.\"",

        "content": "The fallout from Rangers' League Cup defeat to Celtic continues with Jack Butland and Auston Trusty speaking for the first time since the incident that has dominated the post-match discussion.\nTrusty's boot appeared to connect with Butland's head before the Celtic man was shown a yellow card from referee Nick Walsh with no VAR intervention.\nRangers voiced their discontent to the Scottish FA following Sunday's 3-1 defeat , which they ended with 10 players after Thelo Aasgaard's sending off.\n\nWhile Butland finds it \"difficult to accept\" as he fears a \"precedent\" being set, Trusty insists he had no fear of a red card believing their Old Firm rivals' reaction is a consequence of losing.\n\"Was there a massive amount of malice involved?\" Butland asked.\n\"Not necessarily. You'd like to think that you're protected, in a sense, from things like that.\n\"Seeing it afterwards, it was perhaps later than I thought in real time as well. So, a difficult one to accept.\n\"Difficult to accept that that's perhaps a precedent that is going to continue if that's a similar situation against any team, regardless of who it is.\n\"Obviously, with the addition of all the assistance that the referees perhaps get nowadays, we can only hope moving forward that the right decisions get made and it stays as fair as it possibly can.\"\n\nThe sides were level at 1-1 when the incident took place, with Rangers already down to 10 following Aasgaard's red.\n\"I tapped him and obviously it wasn't, I didn't boot him in the head,\" Trusty said.\n\"You could see my demeanour and my reaction to tapping him in the head. No, I didn't think it was anything,\" the 27-year-old said.\n\"I was just obviously apologetic. No one means to boot somebody in the head or kick somebody in the head. I obviously tapped him in the head and that's all it was.\n\"I didn't really think anything much of it. I obviously was apologetic and you'd see my hands to him and say sorry, no matter rivalry or whatever it is, that's not the kind of human I am.\n\"I think it's just Rangers vs Celtic. I think no matter whatever side has a positive result, the other side's going to say whatever.\n\"It's just how football works, you know, in this country and from this rivalry. I don't think you can really escape that.\"",

        "title": "Dominik Szoboszlai: How all-action midfielder became Liverpool's MVP ahead of Man City showdown",
        "content": "One of the enduring images from Liverpool's statement 2-0 win at Man City in February was of Dominik Szoboszlai collapsing to his knees in exhaustion at the full-time whistle.\nThe midfielder, who returns to the Etihad with the champions on Super Sunday , had just turned in a virtuoso, lung-busting display - no Liverpool player covered more than his 11.54km that afternoon - creating Mohamed Salah's opener after a cleverly-worked short-corner routine, before doubling the visitors' lead with a cool finish from his more advanced role.\nHead coach Arne Slot changed his formation to \"play with two No 10s\", one of who was the versatile Hungarian, a tactical masterstroke behind the win that extended Liverpool's lead at the top of the Premier League to 11 points and saw them all but crowned champions.\nWhen, two months later, the title was confirmed, it was one built on the foundations of a new-look midfield comprising Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch, the trio signed two years earlier by Jurgen Klopp after the Reds had decided to pull out of the running for Jude Bellingham.\nSzoboszlai had impressed in the first half of his debut campaign at Anfield, with now trademark piledrivers against Aston Villa and Leicester City, before fading after injuring his hamstring at the turn of the year.\nThe all-action midfielder was then rushed back too quickly with Liverpool still battling on all four fronts, only to aggravate the same injury against Chelsea and be sidelined for 12 games, not returning until March as Klopp's injury-ravaged side began to falter down the home straight.\n\nUnder Slot's management, though, Szoboszlai produced more consistent displays, helped also by his medical team keeping the player in peak physical condition so he could feature in 36 of Liverpool's 38 league games last season, contributing six goals and seven assists.\nThis campaign, however, has seen the 25-year-old's game move to an even higher level, so much so that despite being utilised as a makeshift right back at times after early-season injuries to both Conor Bradley and Jeremie Frimpong, he has been Slot's best performer so far.\nWhether that be in the early weeks of the campaign when the team while winning, was clearly stuttering and needing moments of individual brilliance to get them over the line, such as his outrageous late free lick to beat title rivals Arsenal at Anfield in August - the third longest top-flight strike this season at 31.9 yards.\n\nOr during the champions' recent losing run, it was Szoboszlai again outperforming his team-mates, as seen in the 3-2 defeat at Brentford, while it should come as no surprise that when Slot urgently needed his side to get back on track ahead of a massive week, it was the Hungary international again to the fore.\n\nHaving both assisted and scored in Liverpool's 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League , the midfielder then saved his best for last with two man-of-the-match displays as Aston Villa and Real Madrid were beaten at Anfield to get the Reds back on track.\nCharacteristically, Szoboszlai outran all his team-mates [11.18km] against Villa last Saturday night, while on Tuesday evening he covered the second-most distance against Real, creating the winner for Mac Allister with an undefendable cross and having five shots - four on target - as well as playing three key passes.\nAnd it is no coincidence that in seeking a way to end Liverpool's four-match losing run in the league, Slot opted to go back to basics and revert to the make-up of last season's title-winning midfield.\nThat meant no more Szoboszlai playing out of position at right back as the team was losing his vital dynamism and running power in midfield - see the way he pressed to steal possession on the edge of the area and set up a one-on-one chance against Villa - while it also meant positioning the No 8 closer to Salah on the right of the Reds' front three, immediately reinvigorating the Egyptian.\n\n\"He's been outstanding throughout the whole season,\" said Slot ahead of Sunday's trip to City. \"But these two games bought even more out of the team and out of him.\n\"Dominik has a lot of qualities and one of them is his work without the ball. In the last two games, that was even above his own standards.\"\nAll of which means the Liverpool boss will be loathe to change things at the Etihad [unless he went with the same formation as in February's win], with Szoboszlai's increasing influence on the champions such that £116.5m summer signing Florian Wirtz's only real way of keeping his starting place is by edging out Cody Gakpo on the left of the forward line.\nWatch Man City vs Liverpool live on Sky Sports this weekend from 4pm, kick-off 4.30pm",

        "title": "Joey Barton trial: Jury retires to consider verdicts in social media posts case involving Jeremy Vine, Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko",
        "content": "The jury in the trial of Joey Barton who is accused of sending \"grossly offensive\" social media posts has retired to consider its verdicts.\nBarton, 43, is said to have \"crossed the line between free speech and a crime\" with tweets about broadcaster Jeremy Vine and TV football pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko.\nFollowing a televised FA Cup tie in January 2024 between Crystal Palace and Everton he likened Ward and Aluko on a post on X, formerly Twitter, to the \"Fred and Rose West of football commentary\".\nHe went on to superimpose the faces of the two women on to a photograph of the serial murderers.\nBarton also tweeted Aluko was in the \"Joseph Stalin/Pol Pot category\" as she had \"murdered hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of football fans' ears\" and in a separate post wrote: \"Only there to tick boxes. DEI is a load of s***. Affirmative action. All off the back of the BLM/George Floyd nonsense\".\nThe ex-Manchester City and Newcastle midfielder - now a social commentator with 2.7m followers on X - is said to have suggested Vine had a sexual interest in children after the TV and radio presenter sent a message querying whether Barton had a \"brain injury\".\nBarton repeatedly referred to Vine as \"bike nonce\" and asked him: \"Have you been on Epstein Island? Are you going to be on these flight logs? Might as well own up now because I'd phone the police if I saw you near a primary school on ya bike.\"\nBarton told Liverpool Crown Court he believes he is the victim of a \"political prosecution\" and denied his aim was \"to get clicks and promote himself\".\nHe said his posts about Ward and Aluko were \"dark and stupid humour\" and he was \"trying to make a serious point in a provocative way\".\nHis Epstein tweet to Vine was \"crude banter\" and that \"bike nonce\" was a known phrase used by non-cyclists about cyclists, he said. Barton said he had no intention of implying Vine was a paedophile.\nIn his closing speech to the jury of seven men and five women, prosecutor Peter Wright KC said Barton had crossed the line \"by some considerable margin\" beyond what is tolerable in society.\nHe said: \"Mr Barton is not the victim here. He is not the free speech crusader that he would like to paint himself to be. He is not some martyr to be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness.\n\"He is just simply an undiluted, unapologetic bully. A little bully who takes pleasure sitting there with his phone in his hand and then posting these slurs.\"\nMr Wright said Ward, Aluko and Vine were the \"collateral damage of his self-promotion\".\nIn his closing speech, Simon Csoka KC, defending, told the jurors it was for them to decide where the line between free speech and crime was but suggested if it was fixed \"far too low\" then free speech is \"completely worthless\".\nHe said free expression in society should not be taken for granted and needed to be protected and cherished but \"it comes with a price\".\nMr Csoka said: \"One of the prices is that people will say things that are puerile and offensive. They may say things that are hurtful or in bad taste.\n\"They may get it wrong with a wind-up. They may not realise the impact of what they say.\n\"But those are all things, are they not, that can be tolerated and the reason they can is because freedom of speech is so important.\n\"What we say is that these idiotic or, at times, even offensive, shocking tweets do not go beyond the line. They don't become grossly offensive.\"\nBarton, of Widnes, Cheshire, denies 12 counts of sending a grossly offensive electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety between January and March last year.",

        "title": "Premier League: In-form Danny Welbeck and Ollie Watkins' scoring troubles among talking points ahead of packed Super Sunday 2pm kick-offs",
        "content": "Sky Sports Multiview is back for another action-packed Super Sunday, allowing you to stay across FOUR Premier League games at once.\nAston Villa vs Bournemouth, Brentford vs Newcastle, Crystal Palace vs Brighton and Nottingham Forest vs Leeds all kick off at 2pm on Sunday, and Sky Sports Multiview allows you to watch them all at once or focus in on one.\nWhat a way to warm up for the big 4.30pm showdown between Man City vs Liverpool, which is also live on Sky Sports.\nBelow, we have all you need to know about Sky Sports Multiview but first, let's take a look at the big talking points around each of those 2pm kick-offs...\nAston Villa have addressed their poor start to the season and will have been boosted by Thursday's Europa League win over Maccabi Tel Aviv but underlying and worrying issues remain for Unai Emery to solve.\nWith four wins in their last five league outings, Villa have managed to climb into 11th place after going without a win or goal scored in their first four games. But the 2-0 loss to a struggling Liverpool side was a stark reminder that they remain short of their former levels.\nVilla rank second bottom in expected goals (xG) accumulated, fourth bottom in big chances created and third bottom in goals scored. It comes as no surprise that striker Ollie Watkins is struggling with just one goal in 10 appearances. England boss Thomas Tuchel revealed the Villa striker is managing an injury, after not picking him for the November internationals.\nBut Watkins is not missing chances; Villa just aren't creating enough of them for him. The 29-year-old, who has hit double figures in the Premier League in each of his five seasons since joining from Brentford, needs a supply line.\nThe clash against the Cherries is the next chance for Emery's men to continue the recovery.\n\nEddie Howe's damning verdict of Newcastle's \"unrecognisable\" performance at West Ham has ramped up the pressure on his side to improve their dismal away form, in which they're winless from their last eight games, scoring just four goals. Anthony Gordon's injury doesn't help.\nThe mood on Tyneside is souring with Newcastle in the bottom half having spent £260m in the summer. They are becoming an efficient cup side, making progress in the Carabao Cup and Champions League, but are lacking consistency in the Premier League.\nNewcastle's strongest midfield of Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton looked tired in east London last weekend, unable to even overpower an under-pressure West Ham side considered legless.\nNow they head to the other side of the capital to face a Brentford team spurred on by the dogged Jordan Henderson in midfield that has beaten Liverpool, Man Utd and Aston Villa and drawn with Chelsea on home turf this season.\n\nSo there was no England recall for Danny Welbeck. But that makes him no less of a threat at Selhurst Park on Sunday.\nThe fact there had been such strong calls for Thomas Tuchel to end Welbeck's seven-year absence from the national team set-up underlines the form the Brighton striker is in and what he brings to Fabian Hurzeler's side.\nHis 35th birthday is fast approaching but it is a combination of experience, understanding of the game and scoring skills which continue to make Welbeck a major problem for Premier League defences. With six goals in his last five Premier League appearances, Palace will have to be wary of an in-form forward who may feel he has a point to prove after being overlooked by England.\n\nAfter a brief reprieve, Leeds' goalscoring problem is back. Three from their last four matches, and only four in open play all season, has raised questions manager Daniel Farke first floated himself about their ability in the final third.\nFarke openly pondered whether Leeds had bolstered their attacking ranks enough when the transfer window shut and two months on it has become a growing concern. Leeds have created better chances than Bournemouth this season but failed to finish them off and have the fourth-worst xG underperformance in the league.\nNoah Okafor is a rare exception and one of only four players in the squad to have met their expected goals tally. Concerningly Lukas Nmecha and Dominic Calvert-Lewin - the squad's two best No 9s and in theory, most reliable goalscorers, are the worst culprits.\nWe will have to see whether this is the perfect opportunity for Nottingham Forest to pick up a first clean sheet of the season, under a head coach in Sean Dyche who prides himself on them, or one for Leeds to find their shooting boots ahead of a tough run of fixtures.\nIt is a new, unique feature on Sky Sports where, for the first time in the UK and Ireland, viewers can watch FOUR Premier League matches at once.\nThis means all four matches in the Premier League kicking off at 2pm on Sunday will be able to be watched simultaneously on the same screen.\nEach match will be able to be viewed individually on separate Sky Sports channels, too.\nMultiview will be accessible to TV viewers through the Sky Sports TV app and on Match Choice via the Red Button. It will also be available on Sky Glass and Sky Stream. Or you can watch it via the Sky Sports app .\nAs demonstrated from the image above, Multiview shows every available game with one broadcast in one large box and the others across three smaller ones on the right-hand side.\nThe match shown in the large box will alternate, depending on where the most prominent action is taking place at that time, and you will see every goal and every incident from those four games.\nViewers will always see the ball in play somewhere, to ensure a fast-paced experience.\nThere will be one set of commentators - Andy Bishop and Lee Hendrie - across all four games.\nHowever, if viewers are watching one game individually, away from Multiview, there will be separate commentary, as well as the same half-time and full-time analysis you've come to know.\nAll of the build-up to all four of Sunday's games will available on Sky Sports Premier League from 12.30pm.\nThe Multiview stream then becomes available at 1.55pm, ahead of kick-off at 2pm.\nAt full-time, all of the goals from the four matches will be shown, before the main coverage continues on Sky Sports Premier League ahead of the 4.30pm kick-off.\nNo!\nFollowing the conclusion of the final game of the day at 4.30pm, Extra Time, with Jamie Carragher and Dave Jones , will air between 7.30pm and 8.30pm on Sky Sports Premier League .\nViewers will be able see highlights from all five of Sunday's matches, plus Jamie will be giving his take on all 10 teams who play on Sunday, attacking any of the main talking points.\nA reminder: if you are a Sky Sports subscriber, you can stream ALL the Sky Sports channels straight from your device - at no extra cost!\nThat includes EVERY Premier League match which is live on Sky Sports.\nThe Sky Sports app is the place to get the biggest and latest sports news stories, live blogs, updates on live goals as they go in and all the video highlights of the Premier League, Championship and much more.\nDownload the Sky Sports app now on:",

        "content": "Barcelona staged an open training session at their new-look Nou Camp on Friday in front of 21,795 supporters as they edged closer to returning to the stadium.\nBarca have not played at their iconic ground since 2023 - a total of 895 days - due to a £1.25bn refurbishment, with home matches taking place at the Olympic Stadium in the city.\nFriday's training session ahead of Sunday's LaLiga match against Celta Vigo served as a test event before the club return for matches later this month.\nIt was head coach Hansi Flick's first experience at Nou Camp and for Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford as a Barcelona player.\nBarcelona president Joan Laporta has said the plan is to be back for either the LaLiga fixture against Athletic Club on November 22 or a week later when Flick's side host Alaves, coinciding with the club's 126th anniversary. The club then welcomes Atletico Madrid in the league on December 2.\nThe club is waiting for two licences which are anticipated to be permitted before the end of the year. The first will allow them to hold 45,000 spectators, with the second making the stadium fully operational.\nBarcelona currently have a licence for the stadium to hold 25,991 people, which was granted in October, but will wait until they can welcome more fans before returning officially.\nWork remains ongoing on the ground with the third tier and the roof still to be added. The first two tiers are nearing completion and the current estimate is that the stadium will be finished in 2027, as the capacity increases until reaching 105,000.\nBarcelona had hoped to return by the end of 2024 and then targeted early 2025 before pushing back the date to the beginning of this season.\nThey had to play their first two games of the season at the 6,000-capacity Estadi Johan Cruyff because the Olympic Stadium was not available or ready to stage matches. The club has played their last five home games there.",

        "content": "Preston striker Milutin Osmajic has been handed a nine-game ban for allegedly racially abusing Burnley's Hannibal Mejbri earlier this year.\nIt was alleged the forward had breached FA Rule E3.1 by acting in an improper manner and/or using abusive and/or insulting words towards the Clarets midfielder during their Championship fixture on February 15 .\nIt was also alleged this matter constituted an \"aggravated breach\", which is defined in FA Rule E3.2, as the words included a reference - whether express or implied - to colour and/or race.\nOsmajic denied the charge against him.\nHowever, an independent regulatory commission found the charge to be proven and has imposed an immediate nine-match suspension, a £21,000 fine and mandatory education course.\nThe FA says the the regulatory commission's written reasons \"will be published in due course\".\nThe 26-year-old will not be available to play again until North End's trip to Stoke on Boxing Day.\nA statement released by Preston said: \"We are extremely disappointed at the decision made by an independent regulatory commission to sanction Milutin Osmajic and impose a nine-match suspension, following an incident which took place in a league fixture against Burnley on February 15, 2025.\n\"We note that the outcome was determined on the 'balance of probabilities' rather than one that is 'beyond reasonable doubt'.\n\"We also note that the FA determined that this decision offers no moral judgement, was not premeditated nor any comment about his general character.\n\"Milutin has always pleaded his innocence of the charge and continues to do so. We continue to be fully supportive of our player.\n\"We are proud of our equity, diversity and inclusion policies and practices, and we reaffirm our opposition to all forms of discrimination.\"\nFollowing the game in February, Hannibal posted on X : \"I will not be silent about what happened today.

        "title": "Arne Slot exclusive: Pep Guardiola praise ahead of Man City clash, Virgil van Dijk form and the Premier League title race",
        "content": "Ahead of a huge clash with Manchester City on Super Sunday , Liverpool boss Arne Slot has praised his opposite number Pep Guardiola, discussed the form of Virgil van Dijk and the Premier League title race.\nLiverpool head to the Etihad having won their last two games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid. Before that, they had lost six of their previous seven games in all competitions.\nMan City have responded well to a defeat at Aston Villa two weeks ago, with both teams aiming to close the gap on Arsenal at the the top of the table, live on Sky Sports.\nSlot covered this and more as he sat down for an exclusive chat with Sky Sports' Juliette Ferrington ahead of the Super Sunday showdown...\nGuardiola will manage his 1,000th game in football on Sunday, and Slot spoke of his long-time admiration for how the Man City boss has coached his teams.\nHe said: \"You're always looking forward to watching his team play. When you are analysing every opponent, it's always nice when you play against his teams because then you have the privilege to watch five, six, seven games of his team and you never get bored.\n\n\"At least I never get bored because his team always have a very good and clear idea in ball possession, they always try to make the people happy.\n\"It's a joy to watch where so many other games are not, in my opinion, a joy to watch anymore.\n\"It's become more [about] time-wasting and things I don't like that much about the game, but which are very good tools to use to make it difficult for other teams if they play against you. It's a new tactic in football, I would say, but this is something Pep's teams hardly do.\n\"And of course, the Barcelona team was unbelievable. Hoping they would play on a Sunday night at 8pm, so there was one thing to look forward to at the end of the weekend.\n\n\"Then when he went to his other teams, he also invented new things like the inverted full-back. It's always something special if you watch a game on one of his teams.\n\"A lot of managers win, but in the style he has won his trophies, that is why he stands out compared to many others.\n\"I wonder if there are many managers that start their career now that will reach 1,000 [games], especially at the level he's worked at, because it was probably already very hard to achieve that and there's a lot of sacrifices coming with that.\"\nSlot also touched on his captain Virgil van Dijk, with the defender coming in for criticism this season. He confronted one of those critics, Wayne Rooney, after Liverpool's win against Real Madrid on Tuesday.\nThe pair met on Amazon Prime after Rooney had questioned Van Dijk's leadership once he signed a new deal, which the Netherlands international described as \"lazy\".\nWhen asked about Van Dijk, Slot said: \"I've picked captains at my former clubs where the age of the players were much younger.\n\"Maybe not completely because they were already the leader of the team, but I'm hoping that could help them to become a leader of the team.\n\n\"But with Virgil, it's so clear that he's the leader of this team. When you walk through the AXA [training centre], when we start the training session, you can hear him, you can feel he's our leader.\n\"He's already been so important for this club for so many years, but I don't think I've had many captains that were so vocal, so loud as he is. He's been a very good captain for me and since he became the captain of this club.\n\"He sets the bar at 10 out of 10 and when he has a nine out of 10 [performance], he sometimes gets criticised as well... I think other players will get compliments for a nine out of 10, but he gets criticised for that.\n\"He had similar form to last season, but there were one or two moments this season where he could have done better defensively and he got criticised by that straightaway. Maybe he should it see as a compliment, because that's where he set the bar from.\"\nAny game between Man City and Liverpool is often billed as a title-race clash, but with Arsenal holding a commanding lead, Slot is focused on winning as many games as possible rather than the league table.\n\"If you look at the current league table, it's clear,\" he added. \"Arsenal are six points ahead of City, seven points ahead of us, but when there were 10 games to go [last season] and we were leading by eight or 10 points, it didn't feel completely safe to me yet.\n\"Maybe also because back then we were in the second half of the season so already struggling a little bit. Not everyone noticed, but I felt it and it was harder and harder for us to win a game of football.\n\"Arsenal have only conceded three goals and lost once against us so at this moment, it's not about looking at the league table. It's just trying to win as many games as you can and give yourself the best position you can.\n\"But definitely two very good teams are going to play against each other and what the future will bring, we will see.\"\nWatch Man City vs Liverpool on Super Sunday live on Sky Sports from 4pm; kick-off 4.30pm.",

        "title": "Sonia Bompastor exclusive: Chelsea Women head coach offers insight into playing philosophy ahead of Arsenal Women clash in WSL",
        "content": "As the saying goes - slow and steady wins the race. While 'slow and steady' is often balked at in football, Sonia Bompastor has already won a fair few races since her arrival at Chelsea Women, while taking her time to implement her playing style.\nComing in and instantly trying to change a squad and culture honed over 12 successful years by her predecessor, Emma Hayes, could have ended in disaster.\nInstead, Bompastor has patiently moulded the team into her image. For example, she began to used a back three towards the end of last season, moving away from her previously deployed back four, as Chelsea stormed to a domestic treble.\nHayes was known for her tactical fluidity , but Bompastor prefers a back three in her own footballing philosophy and has continued with it this term. It was something she was already looking to introduce when she arrived at Chelsea last summer, while being productive at both ends of the pitch.\nAhead of Saturday's WSL showdown with Arsenal Women, Bompastor exclusively told Sky Sports : \"It was planned from the beginning. It's part of who I am as a manager, my philosophy, my vision.\n\"I just needed to make sure players are on board with that and it takes time. People think it can be easy, but it's not. We have people coming from different countries, not always speaking the same language, which can sometimes be a challenge.\n\"You need to make sure everyone understands the same and when you think about it, having 11 players who understand the same thing in the same moment of the game, it's a big challenge.\n\n\"So it's a lot of work in training sessions, a lot of video also for the players to understand what we want to achieve. The players are smart, they do understand what we want to achieve, so they contribute themselves towards that.\n\"We're probably not yet where I want us to be, we probably never will because, again, it's really difficult, but I'm quite happy with what we are achieving so far.\n\"The mentality in this team is great. What we are doing on the pitch, we always find a way to win.\n\"People sometimes comment a lot on our way to play, but when I analyse the games and I look at the statistics, most of the time, we are dominant in many ways.\n\"As much as people want us to probably have the ball most of the time and everything, we always try to be in control, we always try to be dominant.\n\"The most important thing in football is to be efficient and clinical, so if we are able to do that, I'm happy.\"\nThat applies to both end of the pitch. Chelsea have conceded just three goals this season - the fewest in the WSL - and are yet to lose in the league. In fact, they have never lost a domestic match under Bompastor.\nIf the Blues avoid defeat at the Emirates, they will match their own record of 33 WSL games unbeaten, although this is a streak Bompastor is not interested in.\n\"I think this unbeaten run is more for the media to comment on,\" she reflected. \"For us, a new season, we are starting from zero. We haven't done anything yet, except winning some important games in the league.\n\"For that reason, we are not really focusing on that as a team and even less as a manager. Every game is important. We are taking it game-by-game and that's what matters the most for us.\"\nThe trip to Arsenal could again see Ellie Carpenter and Lucy Bronze line up on Chelsea's right. When the Australian signed in the summer, there were questions over how the two would be used together.\nBut in Saturday's 2-0 win against London City Lionesses , the pair played together for the first time to fine effect - Carpenter even scored her first Chelsea goal.\n\"Lucy and Ellie are two great athletes,\" Bompastor said of her right-sided pair. \"I don't want to have to make a choice between them when they are both performing.\n\"Maybe in the future I will have to do that, depending on how we play with a back three or four, but at the same time if I think both can fit together and can play together, it will be great.\n\n\"Both have a lot of experience at international level. They have different profiles, different qualities and having them playing together gives a lot of power to the team. They know how to defend, they know how to attack together, so it's a big strength for us.\"\nHaving two players of such quality vying for similar starting spots further highlights the depth Bompastor has at her disposal. Her matchday squads are full of international experience and multi-trophy winners.\nThis season, Chelsea have had eight different WSL goalscorers and made the most changes to their starting XIs (18) as they bid to compete on multiple fronts once again.\n\"It's really crucial,\" Bompastor said of her squad. \"When you are the Chelsea manager, you have to rotate your squad and you have a lot of quality and depth.\n\"You need to make sure you maintain the right balance for people to feel they are part of the success. For that reason, it's really important for me as a manager to give the opportunity to everyone to perform and to be involved.\n\"When you have to play every three days, three games a week, that's really important to have some fresh legs. If you don't have the depth, it's really difficult to match your ambitions.\"\nWhile rotation is key, one player who has been a stalwart of Chelsea XIs for many years is Millie Bright. Should she feature against Arsenal, she will match Jordan Nobbs' WSL record of 210 appearances.\nAgainst Liverpool next Sunday, live on Sky Sports, the Blues captain could surpass her former England team-mate and make history.\n\"It just shows how good she's been playing at the highest level for so long,\" Bompastor said of her defender. \"She's been part of this club for so long, she's part of the base and the foundations and she's already brought a lot to this club.\n\"When I was the Lyon manager, I was always impressed with Millie, the player she was on the pitch, but joining Chelsea, I'm even more impressed because she's a good player, but also a good person.\n\"It's really important for me also to have the opportunity to work with athletes who have the quality on the pitch and outside if it. Every day, she shows good values and sets the example for others. It's lovely to work with someone who has this mentality.\n\"Every time we have the conversation, she always starts to say, 'I want to make sure I'll be available to play the game on the weekend' or even when we play every three days. Football for her is everything and I think she gives everything for football.\n\"I'm really pleased to have her as the captain of the team and to have her in my squad. It's a great achievement for her and well deserved because she puts a lot of hard work in every day.\"\nWatch Arenal Women vs Chelsea Women live on Sky Sports on Saturday from 11.30am; kick-off 12pm.",

        "content": "Middlesbrough head coach Rob Edwards has been stood down from taking charge of Saturday's Championship game against Birmingham amid continued interest from Wolves over their vacant managerial position.\nEdwards did not take Boro training on Friday, and a press conference to preview the Riverside clash against Chris Davies' side was cancelled.\nBoro had rejected an approach from Wolves on Thursday seeking permission to speak to the former Luton boss, but with increased scrutiny on his position, the club have opted to remove him from his matchday duties.\nSky Sports News reported Edwards was a candidate for the Wolves role after Vitor Pereira was sacked on November 2 following a 10-game winless start to the Premier League season.\nHe has been among several names under consideration but is now seen as the favoured candidate at Molineux.\nThe Middlesbrough boss has a history with Wolves, having made over 100 appearances for them during his time there as a player from 2004 to 2008.\nHe was part of the club's coaching staff, working with the U18s in 2014 before being promoted to a coaching role with the first team in 2015. He later became head coach of the U23s in 2019, a position he held before joining Forest Green Rovers in 2021.\nEdwards replaced Michael Carrick at Middlesbrough in the summer, and has led them to third place in the Championship.\nWhen previously asked about becoming Pereira's successor at Molineux, he claimed that he was fully focused on his job at the Riverside Stadium.\n\"You know my links to the club [Wolves],\" Edwards said. \"But my full focus is on this job here, which is a brilliant job, and trying to turn things around.\n\"It's all speculation anyway. I never get drawn on stuff that's all hypothetical and I don't want to get drawn on that.\n\"I love being Middlesbrough manager and that's what I want to think about.\n\"All I can say is I've not given it a single thought because my focus is just on this. It's all the stuff that my daughter was telling me about.\"\nWolves previously held talks with former manager Gary O'Neil over returning to the club, but he withdrew from the race , citing a timing issue.",

        "title": "Why Bernardo Silva was Man City's 'master' in their win over Liverpool by keeping possession in the duels",
        "content": "Welcome to The Debrief , a Sky Sports column in which Adam Bate uses a blend of data and opinion to reflect on some of the key stories from the latest Premier League matches. This week:\n\nBoth Pep Guardiola and Arne Slot agreed that Manchester City's 3-0 win over Liverpool was a game decided in the duels but not for the reason that the term is often used. This was about tactics and technique, not being more physical and wanting it more.\n\"It is also easy for players to win their duels if the game plan and the tactics are working,\" conceded Slot. \"We struggled a lot with them bringing so many players into the centre of the pitch.\" He added: \"We were constantly one or two short in midfield.\"\nIt was a deliberate ploy by Guardiola to control the game, having stressed to his players the importance of the duels. \"We talked a lot in the last two or three days about this,\" he explained. Not about winning the ball but about stopping Liverpool from winning it.\n\"With the duels, everybody has the mindset of how I win the ball off you,\" Guardiola pointed out afterwards. \"But what about the duels when I have the ball and I don't lose the ball? When I am being pressed and I keep the ball and I make an extra pass?\"\nThere was a clear example of how this made the difference in the very first minute of the match. Look at the image below in which Bernardo Silva is facing his own goal deep inside his own half, being pressed with an opponent tight at his back. It is not ideal.\nBut Bernardo somehow manages to free himself enough to angle a forward pass towards Erling Haaland from this position. Within seconds, City were breaking on Liverpool, the ball exactly where they wanted it to be - at the feet of the sensational Jeremy Doku.\nMidway through the half, another example. In this image, it seems almost inconceivable that Bernardo is going to be able to twist and turn away from trouble before sending a pass into the chest of Haaland but it is the same outcome. Doku is sent clear again.\nBernardo's brilliance was to be able to receive the ball in congested midfield areas and pick out a team-mate more effectively than anyone else. Despite his deeper-lying role for City, he was still the player who played the most successful passes in the final third.\nEven in the second half, when Slot adjusted his setup, switching Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike so that he had an extra player in midfield at times to combat this, Bernardo impressed. There was a moment just after the hour mark that illustrated it well.\nIt was nothing remarkable on the face of it, engineering a bit of space before opting to pass backwards. But it drew applause from the crowd because Liverpool were pushing and the fans were anxious to keep the ball. Bernardo, as ever, was able to smell the game.\n\"In the way we played today, he is a master,\" said Guardiola. \"The tempo, winning the ball, accelerate, decelerate, the intuition [to know] where the space is, how to manage the situations and so many things. He is one of the most clever players I have ever met.\"\n\nIt was not so long ago that many were wondering if Bernardo's time at the top was coming to an end. While it is Liverpool being accused of being 'leggy' after this defeat, it had been the Portugal midfielder facing this criticism for much of last season.\nWhile Guardiola acknowledges that dip in performance, he has a different take on it. \"Bernardo struggled last season, but he was there. Every. Single. Game. Exhausted. After 50 or 60 minutes [of matches last season], he could not run one more minute.\n\"At certain moments, he said, 'Pep, I'm drained. My mind is not [there] any more, the feet.' But he was there. And I said many times to my players, and to him, that will not be forgotten. That is why he is my captain. Because in the bad moments, he was there.\"\nThe win over Liverpool was a good moment.\nAnd Bernardo Silva was there.\n\nMateus Fernandes has not made a spectacular start to his West Ham career but since coming on late to score a consolation goal in the defeat to Leeds, he has been very impressive as Nuno Espirito Santo's side picked up much needed back-to-back wins.\nIn the 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday , Fernandes showed why West Ham paid the money to Southampton for him, completing 52 of his 53 passes and having more touches than any of his team-mates. Nobody on the pitch created more chances.\nThe presence of Freddie Potts in midfield looks to have helped too, that midfield triumvirate alongside Lucas Paqueta looking more robust - the three men each made three tackles. But Potts has also freed Fernandes to focus on more progressive passing.\nHe was the player who both Paqueta and Jarrod Bowen received the most passes from. Fernandes arrived for a fee in excess of £40m but the 21-year-old is perhaps just the sort of signing that West Ham need to be making after their recent follies in the market.\n\nIdrissa Gueye found the net for a second time in seven games during Everton's 2-0 over Fulham , as many as he had managed in his previous 46 appearances. It was a product of him popping up inside the opposition penalty box far more than has been usual.\nThe midfielder had five touches in the box. That was not only the most by any Everton player but it was only the second time in his Premier League career that he has done so - the previous occasion coming against Sunderland in 2017 during his first spell at the club.\nGueye has been to Paris Saint-Germain and back since then but is still going strong. His 351 high-speed runs while pressing this season still ranks him among the top 10 players in the Premier League. Very impressive given that he is now 36 years of age.\n\"He is not a spring chicken,\" said David Moyes in April. But when it comes to central zones of the pitch, Gueye actually ranks top for this pressing metric. His tackle numbers are down just a little but after a slight dip in form this was a reminder of his ongoing importance.",

        "title": "Controversy reignites VAR debate in WSL as Arsenal draw with Chelsea and Alyssa Thompson shows her value",
        "content": "Sky Sports columnist Laura Hunter analyses the big talking points from the latest Women's Super League matches, bringing you closer to the key stories at the heart of the women's game .\n\"We sell our game short\", said Emma Hayes . \"I feel like second-class citizens.\" That was four years ago, when the former Chelsea boss - now head coach of the US national team - made a plea for technology to be introduced in the women's game after falling foul of a controversial goal in a 3-2 loss to Arsenal back in 2021.\nThe debate has rumbled on in the meantime, with no real progress, and will again be spotlighted by a series of debatable decisions in the latest bout between WSL heavyweights Arsenal and Chelsea. On this occasion it was the Gunners who were denied a valid winner - a goal that would have narrowed the gap at the top to two points. Instead, it remains five.\nSo, let's unpick the implications once again.\n\nThe fine margins of a 22-game season mean titles hinge on microscopic moments. Stina Blackstenius rifling into the roof of the Chelsea net after controlling the ball with her midriff - not her hand, as the officials wrongly decided - will undoubtedly go down as a defining one, and a stain on the legitimacy of the league.\nDon't forget this result has repercussions elsewhere too. Manchester City hauled themselves to the top of the table after narrowly beating Everton but have every right to feel as if they should be further ahead. Every other competitor with designs on beating Chelsea to the title for the first time since 2019 - when Arsenal last won it - should feel that way too.\nUsually-reserved Arsenal head coach Renee Slegers was booked for her remonstrations at the disallowed goal on the touchline and her reaction was warranted. \"We were very surprised,\" she said post-match. \"I don't see any players calling for it.\"\nMost decisions on a football pitch can be interpreted via players' body language. Not a single Chelsea player looked to the referee to save them from Blackstenius' second-half strike. Lucy Bronze sank in consternation, accepting that the defending had not been good enough to prevent the Arsenal forward slamming beyond Hannah Hampton. Alas. Referee Mel Burgin saw it differently.\nTo add insult to injury Frida Maanum was then denied by a marginal offside decision, which, to the naked eye, looked level. In this particular instance it was Arsenal who were robbed but really the discussion concerns the entire league. Petition papers at the ready.\n\n\"If you were to ask me now if I was in favour of VAR, I would say yes,\" Slegers added, unprompted. She is not the first to voice her appeal. Sonia Bompastor is pro-technology too, citing the need to balance \"one of the most beautiful games in the world\" with refereeing of the same standard. Manchester United boss Marc Skinner has previously had his say.\n\"The officials today have had a huge impact on Arsenal's ability to win the title this season,\" said Sky Sports pundit Izzy Christiansen from the Emirates. \"We need a massive push and acceleration towards technology being introduced\". Of course the infrastructure needed to accommodate VAR and who pays for it are different conversations entirely.\nThe heat was definitely on Slegers and she delivered in, arguably, the biggest test of her domestic credentials to date. She will take heart from that despite the injustice. The game followed the pattern pre-match analysis suggested it would as Chelsea started strong and Arsenal finished the stronger, levelling via Alessia Russo.\nSlegers won't like the outcome but has to accept it, perhaps with the only comfort being the increased attention for the fight in favour of adequate technology to elevate the women's game in line with advancements made in the men's - which can only be considered a good and necessary thing.\nSky Sports has been assured that the league is working with clubs, venues and relevant stakeholders to be ready for the deployment of VAR, whenever that might be. This latest debacle would suggest it cannot come soon enough.\nDespite the controversy, there were several standout performances from the Arsenal-Chelsea showdown and to focus solely on the officiating would be a disservice to the quality of those.\nBoth scorers shone, with Alyssa Thompson impressing as she continues to acclimatise to the WSL with breath-taking ease. Her goal was a move started and finished by her, beginning just short of halfway and ending with a superb lob over Daphne van Domselaar. Her momentum will surely snowball from here.\n\n\"I'm glad she plays for Chelsea,\" said Bompastor with a wry smile. The speed and agility she uses to glide with the ball are both huge assets for a side that likes to threaten by breaking on opponents. The way they cut through Arsenal to create the entry for the opener was actually very Arsenal-like. Thompson has added that dimension.\n\"She was on fire,\" raved Christiansen in post-match analysis. \"She offered pace, power and a clever finish.\"\nChelsea have now equalled their own record for the longest unbeaten streak in WSL history (33), despite this latest draw being overshadowed by the fact they probably should have lost. Connections are nonetheless building as Bompastor continues to shape this side into one more akin to her preferred style. Thompson is the 19th different WSL scorer under her charge.\nSky Sports' Rachel Corsie labelled Chelsea as having the \"best quality\" and \"greatest depth\" of any challenger - strengths that have long been the case. Despite losing top spot to Man City they remain on course to defend their crown to the very last because of the unique blend of players in their squad. Bompastor simply has an answer for every conundrum. A solution for every problem.\nUntil that stops being the case, they surely remain the team to beat.\nLast week's column analysed the relationship between Jess Park and Ella Toone at Man Utd and the areas West Ham must address if they hope to avoid relegation.",

        "content": "Hearts remain unbeaten in the Scottish Premiership but Derek McInnes pointed to a \"lack of quality\" as they dropped points again, while wins for Celtic and Rangers saw their lead at the top cut.\nHearts head into the international break seven points ahead of the Hoops, with Rangers a further six points behind. Both Old Firm sides also have a game in hand.\nCeltic have won back-to-back league games since Martin O'Neill took interim charge and Rangers have made it three in a row under Danny Röhl.\nYes, O'Neill could be gone tomorrow and Röhl is still finding his feet, but - Europa League disappointments aside - are things starting to click for the Glasgow giants?\n\n\"It actually feels as if we've lost a game in the dressing room, which is no bad thing.\"\nThere were no excuses from Derek McInnes as Hearts dropped points in a 1-1 draw with Dundee United - their second draw in three league games - as he pointed to a \"lack of quality, for whatever reason.\n\"Draws should feel like defeats, particularly at Tynecastle. But listen, we're in the second week in November, we've got to 30 points after 12 games.\"\nThe Jambos have made their best top-flight start since the 2005/06 season when they had 32 points after 12 games, but it is now different times in Gorgie.\nThere is no risk of McInnes being sacked, unlike George Burley, and they have the international break to regroup.\n\"Some of the players, some lads weren't quite on point where they've been,\" the former Kilmarnock boss added.\n\"They're allowed an off day. Sometimes you get an off day, you would lose it.\"\n\nMartin O'Neill made a shock return to Celtic last month to try and steady what some saw as a sinking ship with internal division, poor performances and Brendan Rodgers' decision to quit.\nThey had just lost 3-1 to Hearts to drop eight points behind and, despite being outclassed by Midtjylland in a \"tough old evening\" in the Europa League, O'Neill has brought back some style and confidence.\nHe has led Celtic to two Premiership victories and a place in the League Cup final by beating Rangers, scoring 11 goals and conceding just one.\n\nIn Rodgers' final three domestic matches, they dropped points and conceded seven goals while netting just four times.\n\"Great to win, great to score a few goals, and just a nice performance in terms of confidence building again,\" O'Neill told Sky Sports News after Sunday's 4-0 win against Kilmarnock .\nThe 73-year-old does not know if he will still be in charge when the Hoops face St Mirren on November 22, live on Sky Sports , but insists the uncertainty is not a concern.\n\"I genuinely don't know that at all, I'll take a little time to reflect on the fortnight that I've had, and see where we go.\n\"If the board do decide that they want to appoint a manager in the next fortnight, that's absolutely fine by me.\"\nDanny Röhl has taken nine points from his first three Premiership games - it took former head coach Russell Martin seven matches to achieve that tally.\nRangers have also kept two clean sheets on the road, ending a dismal club record run of 23 games without one in all competitions.\nThey are still a distance behind in the title race, but they do appear to be finding some much-needed form and togetherness with the fans singing the 36-year-old's name on loop during their 3-0 win at Dundee .\n\n\"We spoke about the small steps, I think in the league we made good steps forward,\" Röhl told Sky Sports at Dens Park.\n\"I see a lot of things that go in the right direction, I see a lot of things that we have to improve. All in all, we should be happy at the moment.\n\"I'm happy, now I can recover a little bit after a busy schedule, but I must say I enjoyed the first three weeks.\n\"I see how big this club is, which potential we have and from this point we carry on.\"\nTheir Premiership lead has been cut, but they are still unbeaten and have managed to beat both Celtic and Rangers this season.\nCeltic have been at home in their two games under O'Neill, with tougher tests away to St Mirren and Hibernian to come after the international break.\nRangers are 12 points behind the leaders with Hibs ahead of them on goal difference, but will no doubt fancy their chances away to the league's newcomers Livingston and Falkirk when they return to action.\nHearts are away to Aberdeen and Motherwell next but, unlike the Old Firm, they do not have a Europa League fixture in between those games.\nThere could be a new manager at Celtic before they welcome the Jambos to Parkhead on December 7, with Rangers visiting Tynecastle on December 20.\nWill it be all change before Christmas?",

        "title": "Ref Watch: Why Liverpool's disallowed goal at Man City wasn't 'clear and obvious error' says Dermot Gallagher",
        "content": "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher explained why disallowing Virgil van Dijk's header against Manchester City was not deemed a 'clear and obvious error' - but Jay Bothroyd believes the Liverpool goal should have stood. Read on for the latest from Ref Watch...\nINCIDENT: Virgil van Dijk's header against Manchester City was ruled out as Andy Robertson was judged to be blocking the goalkeeper's line of sight from an offside position.\nDERMOT SAYS: \"It is subjective without doubt and it is a grey area because it's all about the interpretation.\n\"Everybody sees things slightly differently and that's why you can throw up an incident from last year or the earlier this season and say, 'well they made a different decision'. I don't think there are hard and fast rules.\n\n\"I'm not trying to defend [referee] Chris Kavanagh, but we shouldn't hang him out to dry because he didn't make the decision yesterday, that was made by the assistant.\n\"This was an on-field decision, which was no goal. So VAR looks and says: 'Is Robertson in an offside position? Yes.\n\"'Is he impacting on the goalkeeper?' They obviously felt yes, because he was close. That's why people are going, 'it should be this or this'. It's open to interpretation.\"\n\nWhen asked if the referee should have been sent to the monitor, Dermot said: \"No, VAR is not there to judge. It's not going to say, 'you've got this right, you've got this wrong'.\n\"If VAR says, you need to go and look at this', then you're re-refereeing. They didn't think this was a clear and obvious error. He can only be sent to the screen if it's a clear and obvious error or if it's a subjective offside which they have to go through.\n\"The on-field decision was 'no goal' so what can you do? It can be backed up by the video - he was in an offside position, he is close to the goalkeeper, so they say he's impacting.\"\n\nBOTHROYD SAYS: \"This should have been given as a goal. When you look at Donnarumma, he is coming across slightly to his right but then he pivots to the left, so that means he can see where the ball is going.\n\"Robertson has ducked but, if anything, the person who would be in his eye-line more is [Man City's Jeremy] Doku.\n\"'A player making an action' is in the rule. A player making an action, in my opinion, is if he moves towards the ball or he tries to make contact with the ball. Robertson has ducked. He's made no effort to try to deflect the ball or get his head on it. He's just got himself out the way of the ball.\n\"That's why I think it should have been given and was a poor decision.\"\n\nINCIDENT: Manchester City were also awarded a penalty in the first half following a VAR review. Jeremy Doku was deemed to have been tripped by Giorgi Mamardashvili.\nWith the high threshold we talk about, is there enough there to call that a clear and obvious error?\nDERMOT SAYS: \"I think it's a penalty. I don't think there's enough with the foot. Not every contact is going to be a penalty. But he does catch him with his knee and knocks him out of his stride and he loses the opportunity to shoot.\"\n\nINCIDENT: During Newcastle's trip to Brentford, Dan Burn fouled Dango Ouattara, but there was no penalty awarded and Ouattara was booked for simulation.\nBut as we saw at the Etihad, there was contact. VAR Paul Tierney said \"minimal contact\" so are we seeing a lack of consistency?\nDERMOT SAYS: \"This is where a referee can't win and there's been contact, there's no doubt about that.\n\n\"I understand why the referee gives a yellow card and then it goes back to whether it meets the threshold for a penalty. VAR says no.\n\"There is contact and with the Doku one, there is contact. They are polar opposites with a penalty at one end and a yellow at the other.\n\"That's the life of a referee. It's so difficult. He's given a yellow card because he thinks Ouattara is deceiving him to win a penalty. VAR says it's not enough to give a penalty.\"\n\nINCIDENT: Burn and Ouattara had another coming together later in the game. This time, Burn was sent off and Brentford were awarded a penalty.\nDERMOT SAYS: \"It is [correct]. I thought it was a foul at the time and he was already on a yellow. When he gets a second yellow, he says to the referee 'I accept it' so he knew.\"\n\nINCIDENT: There were a number of controversial moments in the WSL as Chelsea drew with Arsenal. A handball was given against Stina Blackstenius as she found the net, but replays showed the ball did not hit her hand.\nDERMOT SAYS: \"From the referee's angle, she sees the arm come back and she has an optical illusion. She thinks Blackstenius has cushioned it with her arm.\n\"If she had the angle we saw, she would see it came off her thigh. Her arm comes back almost to give her balance, but because she brings her arm back, the referee is deceived.\"\n\nINCIDENT: Arsenal could they have been reduced to 10 players when Victoria Pelova launched into a challenge on Keira Walsh in midfield.\nDERMOT SAYS: \"In this game, with VAR, you could have four different decisions. People say she's lunged in. When I first saw it, she hasn't lunged in, she's overrun the ball and she's got it.\n\n\"But when you see it again with the luxury of slow motion and freeze framing the point of contact, that's with the studs and well above the ankle and it falls well within the category of a red card.\n\"At normal speed, I didn't think it was a red card. But if I was VAR, I would be recommending the red card and that's the difference.\"\n\nINCIDENT: There were also two big decisions involving offside. Alessia Russo's goal stood which saw Arsenal take a point, but Frida Maanum had a goal ruled out.\nBOTHROYD SAYS: \"Russo is clearly offside and that's why the women's game needs VAR.\n\"The women's game is getting bigger and bigger. Things need to evolve, there's no point in having prehistoric rules. The men's game is evolving, the women's game needs to alongside it.\"\n\n\nINCIDENT: Dan Ballard caught Mikel Merino with his elbow as he headed the ball out of the Sunderland penalty box. Mikel Arteta appealed for a foul but nothing was given.\nDERMOT SAYS: \"VAR looked at it. I don't think it's a foul. He used his arms for leverage. If anything, Merino comes into him. There's a clash but there's clashes all the time in football. It's strong defending.\"\nINCIDENT: Martin Zubimendi tackled Wilson Isidor in midfield. He appeared to touch the ball but also brought down the Sunderland player. Zubimendi was shown a yellow card and Sunderland ultimately scored from the free-kick.\nDERMOT SAYS: \"I didn't know that was in law! I think he's unlucky to give a free-kick away, even more unlucky to get a yellow card. It's possibly a misread by the referee.\"\n\nJAY BOTHROYD SAYS: \"If he touches the ball ever so slightly, he's won the ball. It shouldn't be given as a free-kick. We saw the one against Saka against Fulham, where he gets the ball and goes through the player. That's the same kind of thing there.\n\"Not every time you get the ball is okay. But Saka, Gyokeres...unless the referee's association is telling me it's different rules in the box, that should be given as a challenge that's okay.\"\nINCIDENT: There was a VAR check for Brian Brobbey's late equaliser, but no issue with a potential high foot in the build-up.\nDERMOT SAYS: \"A really good goal. He only has eyes on the ball. The [Arsenal] player has ducked in. For me, a good goal.\"\n\nINCIDENT: Aston Villa registered a big win over Bournemouth. They kept a clean sheet thanks to Emi Martinez's penalty save, but should a handball against Morgan Rogers have been given in the first place?\nDERMOT SAYS: \"No choice. The directive is: Is the arm out? Yes it is. Is the arm shoulder height or above? Yes it is.\n\"He definitely didn't mean it, there's no doubt about that, but that's the guidelines we work to.\"\nBOTHROYD SAYS: \"I don't think those kind of decisions should be given as a penalty. That's a severe punishment. Maybe an indirect free-kick. I think those ones are harsh and unlucky.\"",

        "content": "Florian Wirtz has been let down by Liverpool's wasteful finishing and poor form, says Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann.\nThe national team head coach launched a spikey defence of Wirtz, following criticism of the Germany star's slow start at Liverpool since his £100m summer move from Bayer Leverkusen.\n\"Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates,\" Nagelsmann said, when asked about Wirtz's performances this season. \"They somehow don't like to shoot the ball in.\"\nThe attacking midfielder was labelled \"a problem\" for Liverpool by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville after his ineffective display in their 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday. \"Wirtz looked like a little boy. His performance was a real worry,\" added Neville.\nWirtz was supposed to supercharge the Premier League champions' attack but instead he is yet to register a single goal or assist in 11 top-flight games.\nHowever, Nagelsmann leapt to his compatriot's defence, saying the 22-year-old needs time to adapt to English football but also pointed the finger of criticism at Liverpool's wider issues under Arne Slot this term.\n\"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo either,\" said Nagelsmann, in relation to Liverpool's run of seven defeats in their last 10 games in all competitions.\n\"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\n\"If you look at the game against [Manchester] City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes.\n\"So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal; you see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"\n\nWirtz has created 16 chances in the Premier League, the 16th most by a player in the division. His Expected Assists figure is 1.19.\nNagelsmann believes Wirtz's output remains at a high level, even if he is in \"a dip in form\" right now.\n\"We all know what he's capable of, and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form,\" said Nagelsmann.\n\"We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\n\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates.\n\"That would be one idea, because he does not create few chances, it's just that... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"\nSky Sports pundit Gary Neville believes patience is running thin for Wirtz to deliver on his promise after he had \"a really bad day\" in the heavy loss at City, which leaves the champions eighth after 11 games.\n\"Wirtz is a problem,\" the Sky Sports pundit said on the Gary Neville Podcast .\n\"Let's just call it as it is. It's an issue. He's £100m+, and to be fair, I said a few weeks ago [Milos] Kerkez looked like a little boy out there. Today I thought Wirtz looked like a little boy. That can't be the case.\"\nHe added: \"We've been tiptoeing around him for a few months, around the fact that he's young, he's coming to a new country, but he's £100m+, you're going to have to stand up soon.\n\"He's obviously got something, he's a really good player, he's technically fantastic, but he's been mauled out there today by Matheus Nunes and by others.\n\"He's been chucked around the pitch, and didn't deliver on the quality side of things as well, so his performance was a real worry.\"\n\nNeville says Liverpool have to find a way to bring the best out of Wirtz, who has looked more at home in the Champions League since moving to Anfield.\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot, who started using Wirtz centrally, has restored him to his favoured left-wing position over the last two games. He impressed against Real Madrid but went back into his shell at City.\n\"He's a Germany international of great standing, and he looks well short in respect of what you'd expect in a top physical Premier League match,\" added Neville.\n\"They've got to get him up to speed, they've got to get that little bit of tenacity into him, and that little bit of something that means he'll start to get into form, because what they have to do is stick with him and persist.\"",

However, she withdrew from that squad due to injury and was unable to make her senior debut.\nIt is another ACL injury for Arsenal after Michelle Agyemang was injured while playing for England against Australia. The Gunners are also without goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger due to the same injury.",

        "content": "A number of Premier League clubs are believed to have started enquiries about bringing Ivan Toney back to England.\nSky Sports News understands Everton are one of the teams to have looked at his situation.\nHowever, the major difficulty with bringing Toney back would be the financials involved. He is on high wages in Saudi Arabia and has a contract that runs until 2028.\nBut with a lot of striker movement having happened in the summer, centre-forwards are now at a premium and Toney is proven at Premier League level.\nThe 29-year-old has scored 41 goals in 59 appearances for Al Ahli since joining in a £40m deal from Brentford in the summer of 2024.\nHis move to Al Ahli in 2024 did not materialise until Deadline Day, with all parties involved waiting to see if a Premier League club would come in, and Victor Osimhen was another part of the jigsaw.\nNo Premier League side did make a deal in the end - but clubs have continued to monitor his progress in the Middle East, which has remained impressive.\nToney scored 36 goals in 85 appearances in the top-flight for Brentford and broke into the England team during his time in west London.\nHe last played for Thomas Tuchel in June and is not part of the England squad set to face Serbia and Albania this month, with the World Cup on the horizon.\n\nSky Sports' Patrick Rowe:\nEngland have a striker dilemma currently and a January return to the Premier League could put Toney back at the forefront of Tuchel's thinking ahead of the World Cup.\nIn the latest squad named by the Three Lions boss. Harry Kane is the only recognised striker included.\nJarrod Bowen, Marcus Rashford and Jude Bellingham can operate in the role but there is a gaping hole in the team, primed for a player of Toney's quality to fill in as Kane's understudy.\nThe England captain is competing across three competitions with Bayern Munich this season. Heading directly from a congested fixture list into a major international tournament will take its toll on the 32-year-old, who will be turning 33 shortly after the World Cup comes to an end.\nA return to the top-flight of English football would be beneficial for both parties, not to mention for the club lucky enough to secure his talents, ahead of the tournament.",

        "content": "England manager Thomas Tuchel has told Myles Lewis-Skelly he needs more game time if he is to make it into the World Cup squad as Premier League clubs monitor his situation at Arsenal.\nLewis-Skelly was omitted from the group to face Serbia and Albania, with Tuchel stating that, while he is a great character and a valuable member of the squad, \"it is not enough to just be a good tourist\".\nThe 19-year-old has played only 87 minutes of Premier League football so far this season, seemingly losing his place as Arsenal's first-choice left-back to Riccardo Calafiori.\nLewis-Skelly also faces competition from summer signing Piero Hincapie, who was preferred at left-back in Arsenal's recent Champions League victory over Slavia Prague.\nA number of Premier League clubs are monitoring the situation around Lewis-Skelly given he has only made seven substitute appearances in the competition this term.\nBut Arsenal are not looking to sell any players in the January transfer window as they compete for four major trophies - and Lewis-Skelly recently signed a new five-year contract.\nThere are no pressing financial constraints for Arsenal either, but if they were to sell, Lewis-Skelly would represent 100 per cent profit in terms of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), because he has come through the club's academy.\nLewis-Skelly was one of the breakthrough stars of last season, starting regularly for Arsenal in the second half of the campaign and scoring on his England debut against Albania in March.\nHe has gone on to win a further five caps for the national side, starting five of their last eight games, but Tuchel favoured Nico O'Reilly for his latest squad after his impressive performances at left-back for Manchester City.\n\"Myles was a very good team-mate and played for us in the last camp in the World Cup qualifier in Riga, so was Ruben Loftus-Cheek, so was Morgan Gibbs-White,\" said Tuchel following the squad announcement.\n\"But I said last time there is a component to it and that is about competition and performance and the door is always open for guys who perform on a high level regularly.\n\"Myles, Ruben and Morgan got out-performed by O'Reilly, Alex Scott and Jude Bellingham in their positions.\n\"Myles simply needs more starts, more minutes.\n\"Now came a time when O'Reilly had so many starts in that position, so he is slightly ahead for this camp.\"\nSky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth:\nPremier League leaders Arsenal are not expecting to be busy in January unless there is a serious long-term injury or a unique market opportunity presents itself.\nJanuary is not a window in which Arsenal are usually active. Last time they signed players in January was 2023 when Leandro Trossard, Jorginho and Jakub Kiwior came in.\nIn January 2025, they tried to sign Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins but decided against pursuing a deal because of the price and the impact it would have had on their summer plans.\nOverall, Arsenal - like many of the big clubs - see January as a reactive window. The club plan two to three years in advance with the emphasis being on summer recruitment.\nAdd to that, Arsenal currently have injuries to Viktor Gyokeres, Gabriel Martinelli , captain Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus - and all of them are closing in on a return.\nSome may even be available after the international break.\nDepartures are seen as unlikely, with boss Mikel Arteta suggesting Jesus will be an important part of his plans having returned to training last week.\nA number of Premier League clubs would be interested in taking him on loan but it does not look likely he will be available.\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas:\nEverton are prioritising the signing of a striker in January - and hopefully one with a different profile to that of Beto and Thierno Barry.\nManager David Moyes would also like to sign someone with Premier League experience and loans are being considered, although he and the club are aware of how difficult the January window can be.\nGabriel Jesus is a name on the radar, but Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said last week he remains an important part of his plans as the Brazilian returned to training from a long-term injury.\nIvan Toney - currently playing in Saudi Arabia - is a name on the radar of a number of Premier League clubs and Everton are among those believed to have had a look into his situation.\nJosh Zirkzee at Manchester United is another Everton would be keen on if his current club were to make him available - but there is no indication that that is the case at this stage.",

        "title": "The USL: US soccer league bringing promotion-relegation stateside to capitalise on World Cup fever",
        "content": "In one small step for football but potentially one giant leap for soccer, promotion-relegation is set to be introduced in a major US sports league for the first time as soon as 2028 – but not by Major League Soccer.\nMLS was formed in 1995 to capitalise on the surge in football's popularity after the last World Cup held in the US. Thirty years on, another league is working on its own post-World Cup masterplan by adopting the global model MLS has kept at arm's length.\nThe United Soccer League plans to implement a new men's top tier at the same level as MLS in 2028 that - once promotion-relegation is implemented - will sit at the head of an interconnected three-tier professional pyramid resembling the English system.\nIn a major coup for the USL, Premier League chief football officer Tony Scholes is set to take over as president of Division One this summer and be an important voice in promotion-relegation. He is just the latest Englishman brought in to shape the USL.\nThat English influence is evident in the naming of the USL's two existing professional men's divisions, Championship (Division II) and League One (Division III), which is a deliberate nod to the footballing culture the league is seeking to replicate.\nBut is the US, a country that has seemingly spent decades flirting with soccer, truly ready to embrace the global game domestically?\nLeague One president Lee O'Neill, ex-general manager of operations at Ipswich Town and another English import playing a big role at the USL, tells Sky Sports the groundwork has already been laid.\n\"Those stories of the Wrexhams and the Birminghams have educated the US audience about promotion and relegation,\" says O'Neill. \"They've watched their teams on TV from afar go through that journey and there's a natural affiliation to the model.\n\"For fans to connect that with the USL, that puts us in a different position to anyone else.\"\nThe USL will not just be in a different position; it will stand alone in the US sporting landscape. Every other major league, including MLS, operates a closed system for elite teams, eliminating consequence for sporting failure and the drama of a true underdog story.\nFor a new team to enter MLS, they must buy in. The latest expansion fee, for San Diego FC, was a reported $500m.\nIn the USL's new vision owners could, in theory, pay a $10m expansion fee to enter League One with a team in a small community and reach the top of US soccer in two years.\nTaking that leap of faith was a big step for the USL's club owners, of whom a supermajority voted to adopt promotion-relegation earlier this year, having decided in 2023 that they were not ready.\n\"It was a challenge over a number of years to get the ownership groups on the same page,\" says O'Neill. Ultimately, he explains, once they saw \"the jeopardy and David versus Goliath dynamic\" would be a driver of fandom and investment, they were sold on the idea.\nRelegation in Europe can create financial uncertainty for clubs due to a loss of media rights revenues, but the USL is working on plans to ensure movement between tiers is simply a reward for performance, not a threat to survival.\nClubs in the league are already built on local business models, which prioritise income streams such as community engagement and ticket sales, that are more stable.\nFinancial and structural mechanisms are also set to be in place to support clubs when they go up or down the tiers to ensure the league produces a compelling product that is sustainable.\n\"We speak to leagues around the world and one of the things they get very jealous about is that it's a bit like we've got a blank canvas and we're starting from scratch,\" says O'Neill.\n\"On one hand we don't have the history, but we do have the opportunity because it's different so we can learn from a lot of other leagues what's worked and what hasn't worked.\n\"We've got work to do in this area, but recognising those areas early is really helping some of our teams be better in their businesses.\"\nThe US Soccer Federation's sanctioning rules, in their current form, do pose a problem to the USL's proposals as they were made with closed leagues in mind.\nThe fluidity of promotion-relegation creates a scenario whereby a team moves up to a higher division but does not have the qualifying stadium size or owner net worth, for instance, to meet the sanctioning requirements to be there.\nHowever, it is understood that the US Soccer Federation has been supportive of the USL's plans, and the two organizations are in ongoing discussions with a shared focus on growing the game of soccer in the US.\nMLS has historically been big brother to the USL and is the only league to have ever occupied the top level of US soccer.\nFor nearly a decade, MLS franchises fielded their reserve teams in the USL's second and third divisions until deciding to create its own DIII league, MLS Next Pro, in 2022.\nOnce partners, the two leagues will soon be direct rivals. Except the USL does not see it that way.\n\"We're not going into competition with MLS,\" says O'Neill. \"The US is larger than Europe, and think about the number of leagues that exist there. This country is big enough to support both of us.\"\nIn fact, if the US is to fulfil its full potential in soccer, the country needs both. The 30 MLS franchises, which are all elite teams in big cities, are not enough to serve a population of more than 340m people.\nThe USL's network of 38 professional men's teams stretches into regions that have historically been overlooked for top-flight soccer, increasing the reach and accessibility of the sport nationwide for would-be fans and aspiring players.\nAt least 16 expansion teams are set to stretch the USL's reach even further across its existing professional men's leagues in the coming years.\nAlready, the USL has added 10 soccer-specific stadiums since 2020 and there are 12 more in development, representing a $1.5bn investment in infrastructure.\nIn a nation where there are so many other competing sports - American football, basketball, baseball and hockey being dominant - this level of investment gives soccer a fighting chance by improving facilities from the grassroots to the elite.\n\"From my experience, in the UK in particular, the game is passed down,\" says O'Neill. \"It was passed down to me from my parents.\n\"What I'm seeing here is a lot of the young players, male and female, going home and taking the game to their parents, who have maybe traditionally played others sports.\n\"Naturally, I expect a change in the next 20 or 30 years of the game being passed down generationally, rather than passed up.\"\nThe USL's bold vision may be inspired by the global game, but it is unmistakably American in spirit. Perhaps embracing the meritocracy of promotion-relegation in the land of opportunity will be the key to unlocking soccer in the US. Only time will tell.",

        "content": "Swansea have sacked head coach Alan Sheehan after six months in charge.\nThe Championship club's hierarchy felt a change was needed after a poor start to the season, with the Swans currently on a four-game losing run.\nSwansea were beaten 4-1 at home by Ipswich Town on Saturday, leaving them sitting in 18th place.\nA club statement said \"results and performances do not meet the standards expected at this stage of the season\".\n\nSwansea added that the search for Sheehan's replacement is already under way.\nSheehan had two spells in interim charge of Swansea before taking over permanently in April.\nSwansea City owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen said: \"Alan has been instrumental in helping improve the club through two periods of time.\n\"Alan has a tireless work ethic, an honest approach and a positive attitude. He has put his full effort into the job on behalf of the club.\n\"The club would like to place on record its thanks to Alan for all of his hard work during his time at Swansea City. We wish Alan and his family all the best for the future.\"\nSky Sports' EFL Editor Simeon Gholam:\nSheehan was a genuinely popular figure at Swansea and there was real desire there among the fan base for it to work out for him.\nYou can usually gauge that feeling from the social media reaction to a sacking, and when Sheehan's was announced there was a genuine sadness among Swans supporters that his two-and-a-half year spell at the club was coming to an end.\nHe took control at a challenging time at the back end of last season and impressive results following the departure of Luke Williams saw him appointed permanently.\nThis season started reasonably well enough with the club ending September just on the outskirts of the play-off places, but just one win in seven since has led to what seemed an inevitable departure.\nUltimately of the four wins they have mustered this season, three came against the current bottom three in the league, and the other away at Blackburn - who at the time were moping around the depths themselves.\nWhether the quality of the squad matches the expectations of the owners remains to be seen. But in such an open Championship season it is no surprise that a few have their eyes on a sneaky play-off push, and the Swansea hierarchy clearly now feel the time is right to roll the dice.",

You're left surprised.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Spanish FA [RFEF] said that it wishes to \"express their surprise and concern upon learning, at 1.47pm on Monday November 10, the day the national team's official training camp began, that Lamine Yamal had undergone an invasive radiofrequency procedure earlier that same morning to treat discomfort in his pubic area\".\nThe statement added: \"This procedure was carried out without prior communication to the national team's medical staff, who only became aware of the details through a report received on Monday night, in which a medical recommendation of seven days of rest was indicated.\n\"In light of this situation, and with the player's health, safety, and well-being as the top priority, the Royal Spanish Football Federation has decided to release the player from the current squad. We remain hopeful for his positive recovery and wish him a swift and complete return to full fitness.\"\nLamine Yamal scored in Barcelona's 4-2 La Liga win over Celta Vigo on Sunday before being substituted in stoppage time. He has missed six games this season due to a reoccurring groin injury, some of which has caused tension between club and country.\nIt is not the first time Barcelona and Spain have clashed over Yamal, which began in September .\nThe winger aggravated a groin injury while playing for the national team in games against Turkey and Bulgaria, which infuriated Barcelona boss Hansi Flick. He accused De la Fuente and the RFEF of 'not taking care of the player'.\n\"Lamine Yamal will not be available. He went with the national team in pain and did not train,\" he said in September.\n\"They gave him painkillers to play. They had at least a three-goal lead in every match, and he played 73 minutes and 79, and between matches he couldn't train. That is not taking care of the player. I am very sad about this.\"\nYamal missed Barcelona's next four games, while De La Fuente defended his decision to play the 18-year-old. He added: \"Right now I don't remember what Flick said. Neither is it of any interest to me.\"\nIn October , the teenager was once again called up to Spain's squad. But hours later, Barcelona announced a reoccurrence of his groin injury, and he would be sidelined for two to three weeks.\nThe RFEF hit back, saying Yamal had not reported any complaints, but he subsequently did not feature in either game against Bulgaria and Georgia.\nHe has gone on to feature in Barcelona's last six games in all competitions, scoring four goals and assisting three, but Flick has continued to stress that Yamal's groin injury has held him back.\n\"We have to take care about him,\" Flick said on Saturday. \"For me, he changed his discipline. He's much better now. He's really training good, also in the gym, the treatments he has every day. It's important for this injury that he's doing like this.\n\"I think also he comes back to the best level, but it's not over, so it's not done this injury. We have to take care of him, not just us, also the national team.\"\n\nSo it may be no surprise at yet another furore surrounding Yamal and Spain, with future arguments regarding the 18-year-old expected.\n",

Next summer's tournament would be his record sixth and final World Cup.\nAsked at the Tourise World Tourism Summit when he would retire, he said: \"When I mean soon, it's: I'm going back in the days and tell you - I'm really enjoying the moment right now.\n\n\"As you know in football when you reach some age you count the months very quick. So, the moment is good.\n\"As I tell you before I feel very good in this moment, I score goals I still feel quick and sharp, I'm enjoying my game in the national team and Al Nassr, but of course, let's be honest when I mean soon it's probably one, two years [where] I'll still be at the game.\"\nWhen asked if this will be his last major international tournament, Ronaldo replied: \"Definitely, yes.\"\nThat then puts a major doubt on whether Ronaldo will still be playing by the 2028 European Championships which are set to be held in the UK and Ireland.\n\nRonaldo says Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.\nIt has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.\nWhile United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.\n\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored .\n\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.\n\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"\nRonaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.\nThe Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.\nAsked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.\n\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.\n\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",

        "content": "Moises Caicedo is set to be rewarded for his exceptional performances for Chelsea, as the terms of his contract may be adjusted to reflect his status as a world-class midfielder.\nChelsea have him under contract until 2033 but he may be afforded a pay rise based on his performances in the last 12 months. Any change in terms will be done in private.\nChelsea have a heavily incentivised pay structure, meaning the players are on relatively low wages compared to other top clubs but if they play well, they are rewarded.\nCaicedo became the most expensive player in Premier League history when he moved for £115m to Chelsea in the summer of 2023 - a record that has since twice been broken. It took the Ecuadorian time to justify that price tag but his performances over the past 12 months have been exceptional as Chelsea landed major honours in the Europa Conference League and the Club World Cup.\nAfter his performance in the recent 1-0 win at Tottenham, boss Enzo Maresca said: \"For me, him and Rodri, in this moment, they are the two best defensive midfielders in the world.\"\nAlso after that Spurs win, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp compared Caicedo to Claude Makelele and N'Golo Kante, both title winners with the Blues.\n\"He's world-class,\" Redknapp said. \"I would go as far as to say right now, the best of his type in world football. Just absolutely phenomenal, the way he covers ground, his desire, his quality on the ball, putting out fires for his team, chasing lost causes, strength on the ball, always making the right pass.\"\nNo major arrivals are expected at Chelsea in January, so Chelsea will not be signing a goalkeeper, centre back or defensive midfielder despite some fans calling for cover for Romeo Lavia and Dario Essugo, who are both out injured.\nFocus at Chelsea is preparing major signings for transfer windows of summer 2026 and summer 2027.\nAxel Disasi is set to return to training with the Chelsea first team - although he is still likely to leave in January.\nDisasi had been frozen out and was training with Raheem Sterling until he captained the Under-21s on Saturday. That is likely to lead to Disasi being reintegrated into the first-team squad. He moved to Chelsea for £38m in 2023.\nMeanwhile, Tyrique George another player who could leave in January. A move to Fulham collapsed on deadline day and although Chelsea have been pleased with him this season he wants to play regularly and is in demand.\nA player for next summer is Emanuel Emegha.\nStrasbourg's forward has signed a pre-agreement to join Chelsea in the summer of 2026.\nThe 22-year-old Strasbourg striker chose Chelsea ahead of other major European and Premier League clubs. He wanted to stay at Strasbourg for a third year and play in Europe and continue his development before joining Chelsea.\nChelsea expect him to be ready to play in the Premier League next season. He has scored 26 goals in 57 league appearances during his time at Strasbourg.",

        "title": "World Cup 2026: Thomas Tuchel's England squad dilemmas as Sky Sports writers pick their Three Lions XI",
        "content": "Qualification is secured - now the planning really starts. Thomas Tuchel's first tournament with England is just seven months away, and there is work to do.\nThe Three Lions secured their spot at the 2026 World Cup with two qualifying games to spare. Those matches are at home to Serbia in November and away to Albania on Sunday.\nTuchel will then have international camps in March and June to decide his best England formula. But what places are still up for grabs?\nSky Sports' football writers have been deciding what team Tuchel should pick - and every writer picked the following six names to start England's opening game:\nWhich means that, if England continue in their regular 4-2-3-1 formation under Thomas Tuchel, then the following five positions are up for grabs in the team:\nTake a look at which XIs our writers picked to start England's first game to see who the contenders are for these positions...\nSky Sports' Nick Wright:\nReece James would be my pick at right-back, although a strong second half of the season from Trent Alexander-Arnold at Real Madrid could change my mind.\nJohn Stones' experience gives him the edge over Ezri Konsa alongside Marc Guehi at centre-back, while Myles Lewis-Skelly remains the best bet at left-back. I expect he'll get more minutes with Arsenal in the second half of the season.\n\nElliot Anderson's emergence is a huge boost to Thomas Tuchel. The Nottingham Forest midfielder has to start as the No 6, allowing Declan Rice to get up in support of Jude Bellingham, who is still ahead of Cole Palmer and Morgan Rogers at No 10.\nAnthony Gordon's recent performances for England put him top of the pecking order on the left wing for now. England's wingers will need to excel in and out of possession at next summer's tournament and Gordon can strike the right balance.\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nIf Reece James is fit, he starts as England's best right-back. Sorry Trent. It's also time to move on from the John Stones-Harry Maguire axis. That belonged to a different era, with Ezri Konsa and Marc Guehi doing more than enough to justify their spot.\nNico O'Reilly should be the frontrunner for the left-back position over Djed Spence, who is too error-prone, and Myles Lewis-Skelly, who isn't playing enough.\nThe battle of the No 10s should be won by Jude Bellingham for aura reasons alone. Cole Palmer has done enough off the bench for England to be a very solid super-sub option, while Morgan Rogers' form under Tuchel means you worry where Eberechi Eze fits in all of this.\nThat could be left wing, but Anthony Gordon's good form for Newcastle and England puts him ahead of Marcus Rashford for now.\nSky Sports' Ron Walker:\nSix of the England line-up pick themselves for me but of those that don't, Ezri Konsa is a reliable, consistent and fit option at right-back with John Stones the experienced and quality option to partner Marc Guehi in the middle, so long as he is available.\nNico O'Reilly is a wildcard but his performances for Manchester City speak for themselves and there is still time for him to earn pre-tournament caps.\nMorgan Rogers has been consistently excellent for England but Jude Bellingham has that X-factor few can match, as we saw during the last Euros.\nMarcus Rashford is already the leading assist-maker in LaLiga this season and is flying at Barcelona. He has the tournament experience to edge out Anthony Gordon.\nSky Sports' Lewis Jones:\nThe left-back issue for Thomas Tuchel could be solved by playing Marc Guehi as the left-sided defender. He's someone who is comfortable on that side of the pitch and it would allow Tuchel to be flexible in moving the right-back into a hybrid midfield role when in possession.\nAlso, Harry Maguire has never let England down and is someone who grows when wearing the Three Lions shirt - his experience and threat from set-pieces remains underrated.\nTuchel can solve a huge selection headache of the Jude Bellingham-Cole Palmer conundrum by simply picking them both and rotate one of them off the left.\nIt's likely England's first game will be a very winnable one where having both Bellingham and Palmer roaming against a low block would be beneficial. Maybe as the tournament progresses a need for balance on that side would need to be prioritised.\nSky Sports' Zinny Boswell:\nHopefully Thomas Tuchel won't succumb to the pressure of fitting every star into his England team. Balance is crucial and that's why Adam Wharton goes into my team over Elliot Anderson.\nThe Crystal Palace midfielder has a unique skillset at the base of midfield. Jude Bellingham is currently ahead of Cole Palmer and Morgan Rogers in my thinking, but it shouldn't matter too much which of those three plays as long as it is as the No 10.\nFull-back is the area of the team I feel least bullish on. If Myles Lewis-Skelly can get a run in the Arsenal team and replicate his form of last year he is a shoo-in for me at left-back.\nSky Sports' David Richardson:\nMarcus Rashford can solve England's troublesome left-wing position once and for all now that he has been released from the shackles of Manchester United.\nThe 28-year-old was left out of Euro 2024, the first tournament he had missed having been part of the previous four, but has rediscovered his form at Barcelona and offers plenty of experience at international level.\nAnthony Gordon's fearless dribbling should be used late in games to run at tired legs off the left with Eberechi Eze and Phil Foden exclusively back-ups for Jude Bellingham in the No 10 role.\nSky Sports' Laura Hunter:\nEngland are painfully short of reliable centre-backs but the best pairing has got to be John Stones and Marc Guehi. I'd call the left-back conundrum less of an issue and more of an opportunity. Rotating between Myles Lewis-Skelly, as first pick, and Nico O'Reilly - two of the best young full-backs in the Premier League - can hardly be considered a problem.\nThe biggest call is in midfield and who partners Declan Rice. Rice's specific role plays a key part in the thinking. If Thomas Tuchel is asking the Arsenal midfielder to sit, I would be happy to play Adam Wharton, but if Rice is to be offered the chance to advance I'd prefer the physicality of Elliot Anderson as cover.\nJude Bellingham and Cole Palmer are interchangeable at No 10 - another nice headache to have. And I'd like to see Marcus Rashford given a go from the left if he continues to flourish in Spain.",

        "title": "Man City vs Liverpool: Why it's still reasonable to question decision to rule out Virgil van Dijk goal",
        "content": "Howard Webb's defence on Tuesday's edition of Match Officials Mic'd Up for why Virgil van Dijk's goal against Manchester City was disallowed is unlikely to have appeased Liverpool fans still aggrieved at the decision.\nBut while focus has understandably shifted onto Webb's description of the decision as \"reasonable\", there was another altogether more standout insight into the match officials' decision-making process during the programme.\nNamely, that the decision to rule out the goal was effectively made, contrary to Sky Sports' previous reporting of the incident, by assistant referee Stuart Burt rather than referee Chris Kavanagh, VAR Michael Oliver or assistant VAR Timothy Wood.\nThat hitherto-unrealised distinction is clearly revealed in the audio transcript of the officials' debate carried in the programme:\nAssistant referee: \"Robertson's in line of vision, right in front of the keeper. He's ducked under the ball. He's very, very close to him. I think he's [in] line of vision. I think he's (Donnarumma) been impacted, mate.\"\nReferee: \"Ok, so offside then.\"\nAssistant referee: \"I think offside.\"\nFrom that transcript it is plain not only is the assistant referee the instigator of the decision to rule out the goal but, from Kavanagh's passive reply, that the assistant referee is effectively chief decision maker .\nWhile this insight is important in achieving a full picture of what took place, it does though raise fresh doubts about the validity of the decision.\nAfter all, simply put, the big picture of the incident laid out above shows that the assistant referee was singularly mispositioned to make such a call regarding the line of vision between City goalkeeper Donnarumma, Van Dijk and Robertson - with the obvious inference that if Robertson is in the line of vision then he would likely, if not decisively, impact the City goalkeeper.\nBut the assistant referee, as captured above, is 90 degrees to the action.\nKavanagh himself is far better placed to judge whether Robertson is in line of vision and impacting Donnarumma's actions. So, too, of course are the VARs, Oliver and Wood.\nBut despite this flaw and uneven position, it is the assistant referee's immediate verdict - \"Robertson's in line of vision\" - that is, judging by the flow of communication between the four officials, the central, pivotal part of the decision taken.\n\nThe decision to rule out the goal is instantly set in motion, Kavanagh is reduced to the role of passenger and it is left for the VARs to determine if a clear and obvious error has been made.\nBut, as Webb rightly notes in the context of the \"subjectivity\" of decisions around offsides, where a player does not play the ball, determining a 'clear and obvious' error on a non-factual decision would require an extraordinarily high threshold to be made. Put differently: from the moment the assistant referee called \"in line of vision\" there was all-but no going back.\nIt certainly appears odd that the VAR damns Robertson by asserting he \"makes an obvious movement directly\" in front of Donnarumma, when that action actually consisted of Robertson ducking away from the ball. It is also wholly inconclusive how that apparently-damning action fits with a rule, which in full reads: \"make an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball\".\nBut any flaw in the VAR's reasoning is rendered all-but irrelevant by the primacy of the on-field ruling.\nNone of this is to say that Webb is wrong in asserting the decision to rule out the goal was \"not unreasonable\". There are indeed reasonable grounds to disallow it.\nBut it's also reasonable to question whether the goal should have been diluted to an instant verdict about whether Robertson was in the line of vision and if that assertion should have been taken by an official far removed from a line of vision to see as much.\nAssistant referee: Robertson's in line of vision, right in front of the keeper. He's ducked under the ball. He's very, very close to him. I think he's line of vision. I think he's (Donnarumma) been impacted, mate.\nReferee: Ok so offside then.\nAssistant referee: I think offside.\nReferee: On-field decision is offside.\nVAR: Checking the on-field decision of offside against Andy Robertson. Delay, delay.\nSo you've got clear offside position.\nAVAR: I agree with the on-field decision. I think it's offside. It's a clear, obvious action which clearly impacts on the goalkeeper.\nVAR: Chris, it's Michael. Confirming the on-field decision of offside against Andy Robertson. He is in an offside position, very close to the goalkeeper and makes an obvious movement directly in front of him. Check complete, offside.",

        "title": "Wrexham's performance secret: Phil Parkinson's side target hydration to add performance boost with Gatorade Sports Science Institute",
        "content": "Hydration. Not a sexy subject at the best of times. Now try selling it to footballers, laser-focused with a ball at their feet but never known for their love of science.\nEveryone is aware of the importance of drinking the right things in sufficient amounts, and knock-on effect on sleep, on exercise, on all bodily functions. When you're made up of more than 60 per cent water, you need a fair amount of topping up.\nBut even so - how do you use that to grab the attention of a dressing room? Keep it simple, stupid. That's been enough to get Manchester City, Brazil and Barcelona among others on board in the past - and now Championship side Wrexham.\nThe Gatorade Sports Science Institute (GSSI) have worked with those teams and countless others across a variety of sports for a number of years to give players a straightforward understanding of their own bodies and how they can fuel and hydrate themselves correctly to aid performance, lower fatigue and perhaps most importantly to any athlete, keep them off the physio table.\nThis isn't a performance metric you can put through an excel spreadsheet, but the science is pretty unequivocal that if you don't take on enough of those fluids, your performance will take a hit sooner or later.\nWhat can be quantified into something tangible is the definitive - and unique - demonstration of how each individual player's hydration levels are affected by exercise and general life.\nMaking the most of that is where this all begins, and was what first caught the eye of Wrexham's head of medical performance and sports science Kevin Mulholland.\nHe tells Sky Sports: \"We do so many different bits around the players to help their performance but on a match day you really see the benefit, when we can test our players pre-match and post-match - and their hydration status at the end of the game is where we want it now.\n\"Historically, we know they were dehydrated coming into the final stretches of a game and we've identified the players most at risk during that period. We've put in strategies for them to make sure they can go for 96 or 97 minutes - and if you look at football, that's when a lot of games are won and lost.\"\nSo how does this all work in practice? I visited Wrexham's home, the SToK Cae Ras, on the same day their entire male and female first-team squads were being put through a 'sweat test' to assess their individual hydration requirements. It's something they undergo a couple of times a season.\nThe GSSI save their research days for particularly intensive training sessions, ones which most closely simulate the kind of output players will exert on a matchday - both in terms of effort and resultant perspiration.\nI wouldn't call sporting prowess my finest attribute but you can't test without getting a sweat on, can you? But before that, we need something to use as a benchmark. A step on the scales and a urine sample, which are used to show how much weight players lose or gain during a session as well as their hydration levels before things get underway.\nDr Ian Rollo, principal scientist at the GSSI, tells me: \"It's really interesting. Even with a bottle of water you drank on arrival the analysis would suggest you're mildly dehydrated. It's something to work on.\"\nOkay, not the ideal start. But there's 15 minutes on an exercise bike in the Wrexham gym next things going. Soon the blood is pumping, the heart is beating and the sweat is running down my forehead into my eyes, rather painfully.\nAs if to prove the point a 'Gx'sweat patch on my arm fitted by Ian and his team, the same worn by the professionals during their tests, is beginning to show some results.\nA tiny tube has started to fill up with sweat and at the end of the overall session will be used to test exactly how much fluid I'm losing, and what concentration of salt as well. There's a number of patches on my back which will be analysed separately too but in the mean time this will give me, and more importantly professional athletes going through this, an instant idea of our needs.\nAfter the warm-up, it's time for some drills on the Wrexham pitch to recreate the stop-start nature of a match. Players will cover between 10-12km during a game, and while I won't be doing that, Dr Rollo makes sure there's enough intensity to make breathing difficult and leave the patch looking particularly well-stocked.\nOn the plus side, I'm assured that's what the players' ones look like after training too.\nDr Rollo says: \"During one of these sessions is when we would be recommending the Wrexham players something like the normal Gatorade sports drink, which contains fluid, carbohydrates and electrolytes.\n\"Not every day will be that intense, and for sessions like that is a Gatorade Hydration Booster which still has the fluid and electrolytes but without the need for that extra boost of carbohydrates.\"\nFinding out exactly how much of each I would be recommended, as well as old fashioned water, comes at the end of the session after another step on the scales, while the liquid bottle I've been using during the session is also measured.\n\nYou don't need to be a maths genius for this - my weight difference minus the amount of liquid I've consumed, represents my fluid loss during the session. A bespoke phone app analyses the sweat patch and immediately tells me how much I should be drinking during every hour of exercise to stay hydrated. I'm surprised my results aren't as much at the bottom-end as I thought - but it's not quite the win it might seem.\n\"We've been testing athletes for 40 years across a variety of different sports, and of course they all sweat,\" says Ian. \"There's a common misconception that people have good results or bad results.\n\"The more muscular you are and the harder you work, the more metabolic heat you generate and the higher your sweat rate will be. Some of our highest sweat rates we see in American football players - huge bodies, huge muscle masses and they've got to wear all that equipment in really hot conditions. It's the perfect storm.\n\"You also see this in football players as their kit can be completely saturated with sweat during the match\"\nSo good to know it's not just me sweating just by looking at a football pitch. All the hydration in the world won't be enough to impress Ryan Reynolds or Rob McElhenney any time soon, but it might make more of a difference than you might think in who finishes where in the Championship and beyond this season.",

        "title": "Axel Tuanzebe: Man Utd accused in £1m lawsuit of harming defender's career by failing to treat injury 'promptly' and 'appropriately'",
        "content": "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.\nWhile defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.\nThe landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.\nThe lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".\nAn academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.\nThe case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.\nIt's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.\nThe lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.\n\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"\nThe details of the injury have never previously been reported.\nThe case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.\nA suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.\nThe lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.\n\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.\n\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"\nThe fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"\nThe lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.\nBut Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.\nThen United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"\nIn December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"\nIt claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.\nThe lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.\n\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"\nIt was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.\nUnited were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.\nBut Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.\nDr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.\nThe lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.\nExaminations continued into the following month, February 2022.\nThe lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".\nBut Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".\nDr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".\nBased on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.\nDespite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.\nAfter further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.\nHe was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.\nUnited then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.\nThe lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"\nThe \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27.",

        "title": "England: Elliot Anderson leads race to be Declan Rice partner in midfield but Alex Scott and Adam Wharton have chance to impress",
        "content": "Alex Scott, the newest call-up to Thomas Tuchel's squad, says he feels his best position is as a No 8. But he is likely to be fighting for a different role this week.\nThe real battle in the England midfield right now is at No 6, in a more defensive capacity, and so Scott's World Cup hopes may well rest on how well the Bournemouth man can prove himself in that position, if given the chance against Serbia and Albania.\nScott has played in a deeper role at Bournemouth and, previously, at Bristol City, and his stats indicate he is very adept there. However, it is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson - who has dominated the No 6 role for England since making his debut in September - who is top of the defensive stats for English midfielders in the Premier League.\nLet us compare the four defensive midfielders currently in Tuchel's squad: Anderson, Scott, Jordan Henderson, and Adam Wharton - ignoring Declan Rice, who the England coach says he wants to use further forward.\nThe bulk of the statistics clearly show that Anderson is definitively leading the way - especially when it comes to defensive qualities. He is ahead of the rest in terms of total number of touches, forward passes, duels won, tackles and recoveries.\nHowever, Anderson's nearest rival is Scott when it comes to duels won and tackles, while Scott is ahead of Anderson for winning possession in the final third and making interceptions.\nThe heat maps reveal that, of the four options, it's Henderson and Wharton who are naturally the most deep-lying of Tuchel's midfield options - Wharton, in fact, is probably the most natural No 6 of all, and rarely ventures deep into the opponent's half.\nScott is clearly the most dynamic, and is happy to roam all over the pitch, but he will be asked to be much more disciplined defensively if he gets to make his debut in an England shirt. Anderson gravitates more to the left flank - which may be an issue for England going forward, as that is also the preference of Rice.\n\nHenderson is currently beating his rivals when it comes to blocks, and he ranks highly with both long balls and forward passes - something Tuchel has said is a priority for all of his players, to avoid the tempo from dropping in international matches.\nWhen it comes to more attacking areas, the stats would suggest Wharton's greatest strength is the way he can unpick a defence and the quality of his passing. He has created 14 chances this season - only one fewer than Anderson but the Palace man has played two fewer Premier League games to reach that total.\nAgain, it will be fascinating to see how Wharton adapts, if he gets to play alongside Rice in the World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania this week.\n\nHowever, going by the statistical evidence, and focusing in on defensive qualities, it is clear to see that Elliot Anderson is the best of the bunch so far this season.\nI would expect Tuchel to take four or five central midfield players to the World Cup next summer, and with Rice a shoo-in, Henderson looking more secure than ever, and Anderson looking more and more the international midfielder, it may well come down to a straight choice between Wharton and Scott for the final berth (not ruling out, of course, a possible return to form and prominence for someone like Kobbie Mainoo, later in the season).\nRice is England's resident No 8 and will be allowed to influence the play both in attack and defence. Whoever Rice's deeper-lying midfield partner is, they will be expected to adapt to him, be an important playmaker and act as a defensive buffer in front of the England back four.\nSure, Tuchel will have half a mind on seeing which of Anderson, Wharton and Scott can be the best stand-in for the Arsenal man as a box-to-box midfielder in this international break. But his priority will be to assess which of those three can play best alongside Rice, build a relationship and understanding with him, and have the positional intelligence to fill in whenever Rice is elsewhere.\nWith that in mind, with only four matches to play before Tuchel selects his World Cup squad, it feels like this international break could be key in setting the shape for England's midfield.",

We all live in the same area so help each other.\"\nThe club has grown enormously through the power of social media, attracting several hundred spectators to Hollyhedge Park.\nWythenshawe are, unsurprisingly, showing no mercy winning 6-2, 10-1, 7-1 and 5-2 in the league already. \"I can't fault any of them,\" beams manager Kieran Megram.\nDrinkwater adds: \"We're not here to take advantage of any standard around, this is purely to get some enjoyment and fitness. Hopefully the opposition see the positives in it as well.\"\nThe 35-year-old midfield played a key role in Leicester's iconic title victory in 2016. His form led to an England call-up and was followed by a big move to Chelsea, but he played just 23 times in five years and fell out of love with football.\nHis final matches in professional football came in 2022 for then-Championship side Reading. Playing for Wythenshawe has revived his love for the game.\n\"I don't think you can get much more enjoyment out of football than stuff like this,\" he said.\n\"You can't compare it - you get a bacon sarnie and a beer afterwards, it's great.\"",

I want to make as many tournaments as possible and obviously missing out on the Euros was a big blow,\" Dykes said.\n\"The way it happened as well, it really hurt a lot.\n\"I had to just do my best to get over it leading up to that because obviously it wasn't like the first Euros when we had the Serbia play-off.\n\"You don't know what's around the corner.

        "title": "Rob Edwards appointed Wolves head coach on three-and-a-half-year deal after leaving Middlesbrough",
        "content": "Wolves have appointed Rob Edwards as their new head coach after he left Middlesbrough to join the Premier League's bottom side.\nEdwards has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Molineux.\nThe 42-year-old had been in talks with Wolves since Saturday after he was stood down from Boro's Championship game against Birmingham and was given permission to speak to Wolves.\nMiddlesbrough stand to make somewhere in the region of £3m to £4m in compensation.\n\nEdwards takes over a side winless in the Premier League on just two points following Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Chelsea, which has left them eight points from safety.\nHe will be joined by Harry Watling, who also moves from Middlesbrough, and takes on the role of assistant head coach with more backroom staff to be confirmed in the near future.\nBoro had initially turned down an approach from Wolves for Edwards, having only hired him in June, but he missed Friday's training session and pre-match press conference before the club agreed to let him speak with his former club.\nSky Sports News reported Edwards was a candidate for the Wolves role after Vitor Pereira was sacked on November 2 following a 10-game winless start to the Premier League season.\nEdwards has a history with Wolves, having made over 100 appearances for them during his time there as a player from 2004 to 2008.\nThe ex-Luton Town boss was part of the club's coaching staff, working with the U18s in 2014 before being promoted to a coaching role with the first team in 2015. He later became head coach of the U23s in 2019, a position he held before joining Forest Green Rovers in 2021.\nWolves executive chairman Jeff Shi says the entire club needs to be refreshed with the philosophy of Edwards.\nShi said: \"I know Rob very well and I have seen his growth in different jobs. He's a very good person, he knows the club very well, he knows the city, the fans and he is very talented. When he was a youth coach here, he showed his tactical awareness, but after he took first-team jobs he started to grow his own identity, character and leadership.\n\"We need to refresh the whole club with a new coach's philosophy, bringing his own identity and ideas, and we can build on that. We are at a new chapter for the club and Rob will be a key piece of that.\"\nMatt Jackson , Wolves' head of professional football development, said: \"Rob and his staff have demonstrated previously that they can be really good in shifting the culture, getting confidence quickly into players and building foundations for a really positive future. He loves being on the grass and making a change to a team, embracing the tactics of different situations.\n\"The energy that he brings off the field, we have to get it on to the pitch. We have to be realistic about where we are, and we definitely need to be held accountable. We now need to get that belief into the players quickly and think Rob will be great culturally for the whole football club.\"\nMeanwhile, Boro revealed Edwards had \"made it clear\" he wanted to depart the club for Wolves.\nA statement read: \"Middlesbrough FC can confirm that Rob Edwards has now officially resigned his post as head coach after agreeing a contract with Wolves.\n\"Rob had signed a three-year contract with ourselves during the summer, but after he made it clear he was keen to join Wolves, we reluctantly agreed a figure of compensation for both himself and one of his first team coaches, Harry Watling.\"\n\nFormer Wolves manager Gary O'Neil believes that Edwards will have to oversee a major reset to get the club back on track.\nO'Neil held talks about a return to Molineux but opted to withdraw from the running.\n\"I think it's an interesting transition that they've gone through,\" O'Neil told Sky Sports.\n\"Obviously, they've lost big players in the windows just gone. But they spent a lot in the last summer window. They backed Vitor [Pereira].\n\"So far, this team that they've put together has not been able to put results on the board. They're in a transition period from the group that we had. A more physical group that maybe weren't as technical. It's going to need a big reset.\n\"Rob [Edwards] has already been in a great job at Middlesbrough so he must see something in this that gives him a good opportunity to work with this group and give them a chance to stay up in the second half of the season.\"\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\nEdwards leaving a Middlesbrough team in the Championship's automatic promotion places for a Wolves side without a win in 11 Premier League games might seem difficult to explain. Boro are shorter odds to be in the top division next season.\nEdwards garnered much admiration for his handling of some emotional challenges at Luton as they made an impressive fist of their season in the top flight. He had been rebuilding his reputation in the North East after being unable to arrest Luton's slide.\nThat goodwill from the wider public may evaporate following this controversial move but his connections to Wolves are deep-rooted.\nIt is not just the century of appearances that he made for the club as a player after joining as a 21-year-old from Aston Villa. Edwards took his first coaching steps at Molineux, serving on the staff of Kenny Jackett, Walter Zenga and Paul Lambert - even taking charge of two games as interim manager in 2006. He has family in the area, having grown up in the Midlands. It is still home.\nAnd managers do tend to back themselves.\nDespite Wolves' predicament, he will see a squad full of international players who just need some organisation and confidence. For now, it remains a Premier League opportunity. And those are very difficult to turn down.\nSky Sports EFL Editor Simeon Gholam:\nEven in the short time he spent at the club, it felt like Rob Edwards had done a lot to unite and win over the fan base. Good results and a brilliant start helped, naturally, but it was also his character and persona that won over the Middlesbrough support - meaning his departure has left an extra sour taste.\nOne moment in particular springs to mind. Back in September, after fans ironically cheered the substitution of Morgan Whittaker, Edwards was quick to clap back. \"We're a family\", he said. \"If we're going to progress and move forward, then us, the staff, the players and the fans, all of us, we've got to be together\".\nIf you are going to position yourself like that as a manager, you are inevitably going to open yourself to criticism when your actions don't match your words. And it is words like those that can quickly come back to bite you in football.\nBoro owner Steve Gibson may also feel aggrieved, having given Edwards the opportunity to rebuild his reputation after the disappointing end to his spell at Luton Town. The club are second in the Championship, rebuilding well, and there is a real opportunity there to push on and get promotion after eight years away from the Premier League.\nThis campaign feels like one of the most wide open in years. Of the current top six, the most recent club to have featured in the top flight are Stoke - who were relegated a year after Boro back in 2018.\nBeating an in-form Birmingham last time out without Edwards showed the character, resolve and quality within the squad. And the opportunity remains for someone to come in and steer the club forward. It is an attractive proposition for anyone with them so well-placed. But the loss of their leader and the feel-good factor that was building is undoubtedly a massive blow.",

        "title": "Radek Vitek: Man Utd goalkeeper on Bristol City present and potential Red Devils future",
        "content": "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.\nThe Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.\nVitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.\n\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.\n\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.\n\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"\nVitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.\n\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.\n\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.\n\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"\nHaving grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.\nVitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.\nHaving joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.\nBut for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.\n\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.\n\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.\n\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"\nAlmost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.\nPlaying regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.\nIt was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.\nSo could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?\n\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.\n\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.\n\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

        "title": "Martin Ho: Tottenham Women head coach chats coaching career at Everton, Liverpool, Man Utd and SK Brann",
        "content": "Any head coach need to be adaptable, changing their approaches to reflect the football trends. But there are often elements that are unshakeable - for Tottenham boss Martin Ho, that is individual development.\nIt is a ideal that has been at the forefront of his approach since his early days of coaching and has carried him through a range of roles.\n\"I've always had a feeling for wanting to support and help people, then having a real passion for football and wanting to put both of them together,\" he said.\n\"Going into coaching was big for me because I was able to help and support people's careers. Then more importantly, try and build a career myself which I could be proud of with ambitions of wanting to coach abroad and in England.\"\nHo has certainly gone some way to matching his own coaching dreams, while continuing to develop the players under his tutelage at both youth and senior levels. In an exclusive interview with Sky Sports , the Spurs boss walked us through his career so far, and how he implements his individual development philosophy.\nHo began his coaching career at Everton, spending time with the youth and women's teams and learning from those around him.\n\"I was within the boy's academy at Everton first, and learnt a lot about how to coach younger players, how to design and put together practices that could be effective for certain age groups.\n\"Then I went into the women's team at Everton. There was a complete scale up when we went from part-time to full-time and the requirements that the players have, like seeing people maybe finish work and then come in, and how you have to adapt and alter training depending on the load.\n\"I really built a clear understanding of the wider football design and practice. I also had a really good grounding, at such a young age, as an assistant manager with Andy Spence.\n\"He taught me a lot from how you coach, video analytics stuff, how you put that together, how you break down a game, and then how you deliver the message you need for the players, whether that is in relation to the game or to someone's individual development.\n\"That's where I really got a big hunger for individual development and seeing them when they moved on to bigger clubs or they moved on to a new journey.\"\nCombining both elements of his time at Everton, Ho made the move across Merseyside to Liverpool as technical director of women's football.\nWhile there, he helped evolve the girls academy sides, setting up a clear pathway to the club's first team. He also coached the U21 side to a league win.\n\"My passion for individual development and growth was big there because I learnt how to put a clear framework in place for that academy from a football perspective, but also off the pitch in terms of nutrition, performance psychology, the physical performance and how they all need to interlink for a young player to have the best chance of making it professionally.\n\"Seeing players through the U21s to signing professional contracts at Liverpool, it gives you a lift as a coach that you've played that small part.\"\nBefore he joined Tottenham, WSL fans would have recognised Ho from his time as assistant manager at Manchester United , working under Casey Stoney and current boss Marc Skinner.\nHe helped to coach players like Alessia Russo and Ella Toone, who have gone on to win multiple domestic and international trophies.\n\"It was really big for me, seeing Casey work as an ex-professional and a really wonderful head coach,\" Ho said.\n\"I was able to see a different way of working as her assistant. I had clear responsibilities with the ball and how we conduct ourselves with it, but under Casey's game model, which was so good for me, learning from someone with such stature in the game.\n\"I learned so much from her, from leadership in terms of management, how she conducted herself, her ways of working. Her mannerisms and behaviours were impeccable, and she really changed my mind on what it looks like as a head coach. She's someone I still go back to now for advice and support.\n\"My last two years under Marc [Skinner] were really good. I had a lot of responsibility on the pitch, coaching and delivery, and bringing all of his ideas to life in both phases of the game.\n\"There was also pushing and challenging the individual development of those players, some who have moved on and been part of that Lionesses squad and been very successful in their own careers.\n\"That was something I really enjoyed, where I could really bring to life someone else's game model, but also help the individual grow. I learned so much about myself as a coach in that time at Manchester United.\"\nNext was the big step up - from assistant to head coach. Ho replaced former West Ham boss Olli Harder at Norwegian side SK Brann in 2023.\n\"I felt it was a step I needed to take to answer some questions for myself, if I wanted to be a head coach,\" he reflected. \"You always have a feeling of wanting to have that spot, but actually you don't really know what it entails until you're in it.\n\"And believe me, it's totally different. You have more responsibility and accountability. All eyes are on you. It's added pressure, but I thrive off that.\n\"It was also me being able to try my ideas of football, and seeing if they would work or not. It was what I thought about when I first started coaching, putting that into practice.\n\"It was me having to find the ways that we can win games, the way we can develop players and the staff to make sure that they're at the highest level we can be, so the players get all the support they need.\n\"That's probably been the biggest part I've noticed, the delegation and management of staff to make sure that they can be highly effective. I really enjoy this side of it and you don't really know until you do it.\n\"I also had such a big emphasis still on individual development that we enabled so many players to move on from Brann when I was there to go into big clubs in Europe. That will always stick with me. It's all brought me to this place now where I'm really happy and I'm enjoying the job.\"\nHo made history with SK Brann too, becoming the first Norwegian side to reach the group stages of the Champions League in the 2023/24 season. They reached the quarter-finals too, but were knocked out by Barcelona.\n\"Those experiences, when you're in it, you don't really enjoy it because you're so ingrained in what's going on, whether it's your team preparing or playing,\" Ho added.\n\"But when it finished and we played Barcelona away in the second leg, it was kind of like a dagger to the heart. I wish I would have enjoyed a lot more of those moments.\n\"I've matured so much as a coach and as a person from those experiences and I learned a lot from playing against some of the best coaches. I played against Sonia [Bompastor] when she was at Lyon and Jonatan Giraldez at Barcelona and so many other wonderful coaches who we played against in the group phase.\n\"I gained so many experiences, like not getting too high when you do well and not getting too low when you lose, but always trying to find that middle ground of how you can be better, as well as appreciating what you've done.\"\nHo has continued to be successful at Tottenham . After a season that saw the club finish second from bottom, Spurs have flirted with the WSL's top three this year and are currently level on points with local rivals Arsenal.\nBut football is a results-based business. While individual development is also important, results are king, so how does Ho go about balancing the two?\n\"Probably the biggest part of it is the training methodology - how we like to train, how we train the right behaviours, the right technical attributes, and having very clear development plans for the players in terms of us knowing what they can be better at.\n\"Whether you're younger or older, we can always help you evolve because the game changes, you change technically, physically and so on. So how do we help the players change and adapt, but making sure we have a big emphasis through the week on individual developments?\n\n\"If that's not individual, it's either sectoral between a couple of units or also sometimes just players on the same side of the pitch. The biggest thing for me is finding the time in the week where we can block that work out and the players seeing the value in it, which they do.\n\"That's where I feel we can really push that, but not just on the pitch, we can push it off. We do a lot of video analysis, we break down the game a lot collectively and individually. The staff sit down with the players to go through certain actions and characteristics they have that we can probably be better at.\n\"It's trying to find different ways we can do it and that will always be a part of me, but you have to find a very clear methodology and a way of working to allow that to happen. We have a really good one here and I think the players have bought into it really well.\"\nWatch Tottenham Women vs Arsenal Women live on Sky Sports on Sunday from 2pm; kick-off 2.30pm.",

        "title": "Andy Butler interview: Scunthorpe's manager, former player and former postman igniting Iron dreams of a return to the EFL",
        "content": "Over a third of the National League season is done and dusted and Scunthorpe are sixth, but only three points behind leaders Carlisle, with a game in hand.\nSince the beginning of last season, they have lost just nine of the 63 league games they have played. Two victories in the National League North play-offs last season secured automatic promotion back to the fifth tier at the first time of asking.\nIt is hard to believe it is the same club relegated out of the EFL after a 72-year stay in 2022 - and saved from a dark, uncertain future by chairwoman Michelle Harness just over two years ago.\nHarness and her co-owners Roj Rahman, George Aitkenhead and Ian Sharp have worked hard to take care of things off the pitch. And on it, manager Andy Butler is steering the ship.\nThe 42-year-old's history with the club is extensive.\nHe joined the club as a youngster, after being released by hometown club Doncaster, progressed to the first team in 2002 and played over 150 games, winning promotion from League Two in 2004/05 and League One in 2006/07.\nButler returned to the club for a second spell in 2019/20, then finished his EFL career with a return to Rovers, latterly acting as caretaker between March and May 2021.\nSpell number three started in October 2022, when he was appointed youth development phase coach at the Attis Arena - and it came at just the right time.\n\"I was managing Doncaster Rovers Belles, I was a postman and also played for Farsley Celtic,\" Butler - who also tried his hand as a locksmith, plumber and referee - tells Sky Sports .\n\"It only rained one day while I was a postie. It was an unbelievable summer, so I had a great time! The difficult part was getting up at six in the morning on a Saturday, delivering, then rushing to Farsley Celtic and getting out there to play 3pm football.\n\"It just showed me how hard people work in part-time football.\n\"The youth coaching job came by chance - and if it wasn't for that, I would still be delivering post around Edlington in Doncaster. It was tough, though. We had about four members of staff for seven age groups. The academy was dying on its feet.\"\nThen-manager Jimmy Dean later asked Butler to design a set-piece routine and, in June 2023, offered him the job as first team coach, which he accepted during a phone call while on holiday in Greece.\nWithin a week of Scunthorpe suffering a National League North play-off semi-final defeat to eventual winners Boston United the following April, Butler was appointed manager. His career had, unexpectedly, come full circle.\n\"As soon as Michelle offered it to me, I had to take it,\" he says.\n\"If I didn't take it, a new manager would come in, get rid of the coaching staff and I'd back to where I was before. I'd be always kicking myself, thinking what if?\n\"I told Jimmy I'd been offered it and he told me to take it. I don't want people to think I stabbed him in the back, because I didn't. He's a good guy. I'm really thankful I was given the opportunity\n\"Once you're back in football, you want to get your fingernails in and never let go again!\"\nThere were learning curves last season, as was to be expected in his first full season managing in senior men's football.\n\"You see other managers giving three fist pumps to the crowd - I did that once after the first game against Brackley and I'll never do it again, because football turns like that. For me, now it's more, stand back, acknowledge and let the players take the plaudits because they're the ones doing it.\n\"And if I'm being really honest, last season, there was a period around November-December where I could have been shown the door. I've got to be thankful for the owners, for the patience. You've got to try and keep relevant. If you don't, you disappear quite quickly.\"\nButler believes the promotion he helped deliver last season was better timed than if it had happened one year earlier. \"I don't think the club was actually in a position to go up anyway. It'd have been too quick.\"\nBut what about this season?\n\"I always had a little internal feeling we'd do well, because I know the players. I think we recruited pretty well in the summer as well, so I thought we'd give ourselves a good chance,\" he adds.\n\"There are some big clubs in this division who have got massive budgets - I mean, four times the budgets we've got. I was speaking to an EFL manager recently and a couple of teams in this division are blowing EFL clubs out of the water, wages-wise, so that's what you've got to compete with in this division.\n\"Would I really have seen us in the top seven? No - I'd have gone fifth-bottom. But it comes down to the hard work of the players.\n\"We always do a tough pre-season when you see the togetherness in running through the woods. I know it's old school, when you see the group's determination, you think, they've got a chance, these lot. We've got quality in goalscorers, people who can make chances out of nothing, a good leadership group who demand off each other.\n\"Right now we're in a good position, and we've already surpassed what we got last time in this division, so we've done pretty well. But it could easily change. We could lose 13 in a row. I'm happy with how it started, but I still think there's room to improve.\"\nLast season and the start of this have raised expectations.\n\"It comes with added pressure now. There's an expectancy we should be beating teams, even though we've just stepped up. I think people see the badge more than where we've been at the moment.\n\"We just approach one game at a time, and that's the message I put out to the fans - let's not get carried away. We've put ourselves in a good position, but all it is right now is a good position.\n\"The message to the players is don't change your approach, no matter who we play.\"\nButler allows himself glimpses into what the feeling might be like to secure back-to-back promotions - and a fourth overall with the club. But those glimpses are fleeting.\n\"I have three-second dreams about it - until the reality hits home that it's going to be tough!\" Butler admits.\n\"It'd be amazing if we could bring it [EFL football] back. What an achievement for the club it would be, and for the owners as well because they've put a lot of time, a lot of personal money into it, so it's more of a payback for them than personal gain for me.\"\nBut those three-second glimpses keep him going.\n\"Everyone's human, they have little pipe dreams - and I want to be as successful as I can. I don't want to stay in the National League all my life.\n\"In my playing career, I pushed myself, so why not push for something more in my managerial career?\"",

        "content": "\n\nGetting the chance to play against Arsenal brought back a few memories for Cameron Humphreys, having grown up at Manchester City.\nEven for a side in Port Vale that are struggling near the bottom of League One, they gave the Gunners a proper battle when they met in the third round of the Carabao Cup in October.\n\"It was just frustrating that the first goal was so lucky for them,\" Humphreys says. \"I honestly don't think they bothered us as much as I thought they would. It was 2-0 against a top team. You see what they do to sides in Europe. I'm proud of our performance, really.\"\nHumphreys also made two cameos in the FA Cup for Manchester City in 2015/16.\n\"It was unreal,\" he recalls. \"It feels like absolute donkey's years ago now. I'm 27 but feel like an old man because I started so young. They're proud memories.\n\"Playing against Arsenal a few weeks ago brought that back. Full stadiums, great atmosphere. It was really exciting and a bit of a throwback for me.\"\n\nRob Street has been a regular feature in a Lincoln City side competing near the top of the table, but he is still yet to quite find the goalscoring touch he had at Doncaster Rovers last season.\nWhile on loan in League Two, his 12 goals in 22 games helped fire Donny to the League Two title. This season, things have been a little different. Performances have been good, but the goals haven't quite flowed. However, he did score against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup.\n\"I think there were a few different reasons,\" Street says. \"Confidence is massive in football. When you're on a run and playing well, you almost feel invincible every time you step on the pitch. You know you'll get chances and score goals.\n\"We had a strong, together group at Doncaster, a bit like what we've got here. If we can stick together and keep performing, it can be a similar situation to what it was like at Doncaster last season, and I don't see why it can't be.\n\"As a player, the best thing you can have is belief in yourself, and I've definitely tried to bring that into this season. I'm constantly learning. Different roles, different teams, and trying to be as impactful as possible. At the end of the day, we all want to play and perform, and that's the main thing.\"\n\nAged 32 and now playing in Barrow, Tom Barkhuizen is able to reflect a little more on his achievements in football.\n\"Preston was where I played my best football and had the most enjoyment,\" he says of the club where he played from 2017 to 2022. \"I probably only realised that after leaving. When you're in your 20s, you're constantly chasing progress and sometimes forget to enjoy it.\n\"Looking back, that was the best five or six years of my career - great team, great manager, great atmosphere. When I retire, I'll look back on that period with a lot of pride.\"\nBarkhuizen is now definitely enjoying things again as a regular at Barrow, after struggling for games in his final season at Derby.\n\"Last year was difficult, not playing that much,\" he admits. \"I felt like I could have contributed more with my experience at that level, but that's football. It's not always down to you, and sometimes you've just got to get on with it. The year before, we got promoted and I played quite a few games, so it's been mixed.\n\"I wanted to come somewhere I could make a difference, whether that's on the pitch or as an older player in the dressing room. I feel like I've got that here. I've started every game since the first of the season, and I'm trying to be a leader off the pitch and help us progress.\"\n\nInjury struck at a bad time for Jack Lankester. Having just moved to Crewe Alexandra, he was playing well, only to end up injured for most of 2025.\nEven while absent, he was determined to stay involved as he could with his team-mates.\n\"I did a lot of travelling with the team at the end of last year and the start of this one before I was even back playing,\" he says. \"I spoke to the gaffer about it because it keeps the buzz of the game alive. Staying at home and watching on TV would've made me feel worse, but being there and helping however I could made me feel better. Hopefully, those days are behind me now.\n\"I tried to bring as much energy and positivity as I could on matchdays. I'd act like I was still part of the squad, up for selection even though I wasn't. Seeing things from a different point of view helped, and I just wanted to support the team however possible.\"\nNow 25, the move to Crewe was also his first time away from home. It afforded him the opportunity to mature away from the pitch as well as on it.\n\"I think moving away has helped me grow up a bit,\" Lankester adds. \"It's all new experiences, living on your own and adapting.\n\"Some of the other lads like Max Sanders are in the same boat, and we help each other out. We're both southerners living up north, but I'm enjoying it.\"\n\nJamie Walker is still impressing on the pitch for Grimsby Town, but at 32, he has also begun steps for what comes beyond his playing career, having started his own coaching project in Bradford.\n\"I enjoy coaching,\" Walker says. \"As I've got older, I've started thinking about what comes after football. After getting promoted with Bradford, I stayed in the area and thought it was a good opportunity to pass on my knowledge to kids.\n\"It's still early days. We've only been going for a few months, but I'm really enjoying it. I've completed my B Licence recently, and I love coaching and helping the younger generation.\n\"I've got a son, and as he's got older and started playing grassroots football, I got roped into helping out. I really enjoyed it and took more interest. Now I'm properly into it and loving it.\"\nWalker's son, just like him, is a big fan of Hearts. That is where the Scotsman started his career, and where his heart - excuse the pun - still lies. He is hopeful a title push in the Scottish Premiership is possible after such a good start, albeit he remains wary.\n\"My son's definitely a Hearts fan,\" Walker says. \"He doesn't really have any other option with my family! He's got a bond with Grimsby and Bradford too, but deep down he still loves Hearts. When we've got time off, we'll often go up to watch them.\n\"I grew up going to the games every week and was lucky enough to play over 200 times for the club. I've seen them start well before and then fall back, but they've made a great start this season. They've signed good players and have a strong manager, so hopefully this is the year they achieve something special.\"\nEvery game is live on Sky Sports+ and the Sky Sports app, with free highlights on the Sky Sports app shortly after full-time. 3pm kick-offs unless stated.\nLeague One\nLeague Two",

        "title": "World Cup qualifiers: Scotland defender Scott McKenna determined to achieve 'dream' and secure place in North America",
        "content": "\"It's probably something we'll always have dreamed of since kids.\"\nSome of the Scotland squad were not born when the national side last reached a World Cup, but they are now potentially two games from ending a 28-year exile.\nAt least a draw in Greece on Saturday, then a win over Denmark at Hampden Park three days later would seal top spot in Group C, with a play-off already guaranteed as a back-up.\nDefender Scott McKenna, who was only one when the Scots competed at France '98, insists the players all believe this is the time to return to football's biggest tournament.\n\"The togetherness in the squad that we've created over the last five or six years, qualifying for two Euros, there is belief when it comes to big games that we can go out there and perform and get the results that are required,\" he said.\n\n\"For everyone, it would be absolutely incredible. It's probably something we'll always have dreamed of since kids.\n\"Obviously we're still two games away from that and it's important that all our focus just now is on Greece. Then after that we'll move on to Denmark.\"\nScotland have beaten Belarus twice, won against Greece at Hampden and held Denmark to a goalless draw away from home in this qualifying campaign.\n\nIt was points over performance last month against Greece and Belarus.\nMcKenna is adamant they learned some lessons: \"Obviously the points were there, but the performances on the pitch weren't of the level expected and the level being used over the last few years.\n\"That's definitely something that we'll need to improve, but ultimately the points last month are the ones that got us in this position to be able to qualify.\"\nOn facing the Greeks in Piraeus, the Dinamo Zagreb centre-back added: \"I think any team that have already lost the ability to qualify will have a point to prove.\n\"Obviously losing to us last month, where arguably they were better than us for 60 minutes, they'll be coming to prove a point.\n\"But we showed what we can do last month in that last 30 minutes. We'll be looking to try and do it for longer this time around.\"\nThe national stadium will be at capacity when Scotland take on Denmark on November 18 in what the Scots are hoping will be a Group C decider.\nIt is estimated 200,000 of the Tartan Army were in Germany for last year's Euros and McKenna will be preparing for an even greater support if they make it to next summer's World Cup.\n\"There were thousands and thousands of fans travelling to Germany and all the cities we played games in and spent a lot of money to get there to support us. Not only in Germany, back home as well,\" the 29-year-old added.\n\"It really brought everyone together so I would imagine it would be like that but on steroids if it was a World Cup.\n\"The Scotland fans follow us everywhere, not only through these big tournaments.\n\"When we played Belarus behind closed doors, there were still Scotland fans that made the effort to travel and were standing singing outside the stadium.\n\"The support we get everywhere is fantastic, no matter the size of the game. We have a lot to repay the fans for all that support.\"\nGoalkeepers: Scott Bain (Falkirk), Craig Gordon (Hearts), Liam Kelly (Rangers).\nDefenders: Josh Doig (Sassuolo), Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic).\nMidfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Connor Barron (Rangers), Andy Irving (West Ham).\nForwards: Che Adams (Torino), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham), George Hirst (Ipswich), Lawrence Shankland (Hearts).",

        "title": "Sweden must qualify for World Cup 2026 while Alexander Isak, Viktor Gyokeres are in their prime, says Jonas Olsson",
        "content": "It is crunch time for Sweden.\nThey have played four World Cup qualifying matches, but have just one point to their name. Direct qualification is already out of the question - Switzerland or Kosovo will take that.\nOn October 14, Jon Dahl Tomasson was sacked as head coach. \"Football is results-based and we have reached a point where results are not enough,\" said Kim Kallstrom, the nation's Head of Football.\nNow, to have any chance of securing a place in the play-offs in March, they must win both of their matches across the next week against the Swiss and Slovenia.\n\"At the beginning of the campaign, there was such a positive sense about Swedish football,\" former Sweden defender Jonas Olsson tells Sky Sports .\n\"We have probably the best team since Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Freddie Ljungberg, with Alexander Isak, Viktor Gyokeres, Dejan Kulusevski, Anthony Elanga. The team, player-for-player, is excellent.\n\"They have tried to go a different way with Swedish football; normally it has been very 4-4-2, with a very organised, very defensive approach.\n\"Now, they would like to play a bit more attacking football. The problem has been they have been too open and a bit too naive, I think.\"\nConcerningly, the Swedes have scored just two goals across those four qualifying games.\nOlsson believes in the change of approach, but questions the timing of its implementation.\n\"It's valid to change it because of the players they have available, but I think you have to take small steps into it,\" he says.\n\"Looking at the first four games, they were too open and they got punished too easily.\n\"You have to have those ambitions with the players you have available. Those players I mentioned are the strength of the team and you should play to the strength of your biggest players.\n\"I also think they have defenders who are more suited to playing high up the pitch, with Isak Hien, who plays for Atalanta, and with Victor Lindelof. The generation before had defenders - like me, like Olof Mellberg - who were comfortable sitting deep, defending the box.\n\"They definitely should go that way, but they have to do it with a balance.\"\nThe two November fixtures are also the first with new head coach Graham Potter in charge.\nThe 50-year-old was appointed on a short-term contract on October 20, just over three weeks after he was sacked by West Ham .\n\"I think it was the obvious appointment when Potter declared, before he was approached by the Swedish FA, that he wanted the job and that the salary wasn't an issue,\" Olsson continues.\n\n\"That's normally the issue when the Swedish FA are due to appoint a manager as the salary isn't the highest, so they can't really go for the biggest names.\n\"Potter's link with Swedish football is big because of what he did at Ostersunds, but also because of his coaching staff; his assistant Bjorn Hamberg has been with him at Brighton and Chelsea.\n\"Swedish supporters kind of see him as one of their own, so it's an easy appointment to sell and, in terms of getting the balance right, his leadership qualities show he can build a good group of players and a sense of harmony.\n\"But the Swedish national team is at a point where they don't have the luxury to see the long-term perspective. They need to perform now, in the two games coming up.\n\"It's going to be all about just getting as prepared as possible for those two games and whatever comes after that, you deal with then.\"\nOn Thursday, Potter confirmed Liverpool striker Isak was \"fit and available for selection\", but Gyokeres is absent from this month's squad with a muscular issue.\n\nIf the duo are fit and firing, most would fancy Sweden's chances.\n\"It's about getting them involved in the game, putting him in good positions as often as possible. That wasn't the case with the former manager,\" Olsson says.\n\"He wanted to play a high-pressing line, but they didn't manage to do it. The amount of times Isak or Gyokeres was on the ball was very limited.\n\"Potter has to find a way to get them more involved, whether that be pressing high or whether that be being better in transition.\n\"Another issue was with the formation the former manager played, with one striker. It was a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Isak as a dropping striker, but I think they will play with two strikers now.\n\"The chemistry between them hasn't been good at all in the national team, not in these four games or the games in the summer, so that's something to work on when Gyokeres is back, but I do think a change of formation will be a first step towards that.\"\n\nSweden have not qualified for three of the last four World Cups - and Olsson says it would be a shame for players in their prime to miss out.\n\"It would be very disappointing to not qualify again. When we got drawn into that group, with all due respect to Switzerland, Slovenia and Kosovo, everyone felt this was a good draw and we should be able to get, if not first place, then second place and go to the play-offs.\n\"In that context, it would be a massive disappointment, but also, looking at the main players, Gyokeres is 26, Isak is 25, Kulusevski is 25 as well. This is their prime; the next World Cup, they will be closer to 30 and who knows where they will be then.\n\"For all those reasons, it's vital Sweden qualify for this one.\"",

        "title": "Premier League free transfers: Marc Guehi, Bernardo Silva and Ibrahima Konate could leave for free next summer",
        "content": "A number of Premier League stars have entered the final year of their contracts, meaning they can negotiate a free transfer with clubs outside of England from January.\nHere, Sky Sports takes a look at all 20 clubs in the top-flight and the players they could be set to lose on a free transfer next summer.\nMikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.\nNothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.\nRoss Barkley\nA seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.\nWhether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.\n\nMarcos Senesi\nIn the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.\nTalks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.\nAdam Smith\nThe 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.\nInjuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.\nVitaly Janelt\nSky Sports News understands Brentford are currently targeting a new central midfielder with Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026.\nTalks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.\nRico Henry\nBrentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.\nKnee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.\nMathias Jensen\nAnother future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.\nThe 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.\n\nJosh Dasilva\nDasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.\nThe 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.\nMyles Peart-Harris\nThe attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.\nHe was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.\nAdam Webster\nA severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.\nWebster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.\nLewis Dunk\nThe Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.\nSolly March\nWith game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.\nDanny Welbeck\nThe forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.\nThe 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.\n\nJoel Veltman\nVeltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.\nHe missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.\nJames Milner\nThe Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.\nHurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.\nMartin Dubravka\nDubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.\nHis future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.\n\nJosh Laurent\nLaurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.\nVaclav Hladky\nThe Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.\nWith 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.\nAshley Barnes\nBarnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.\nHe then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.\nChelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.\nMarc Guehi\nArguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.\nRumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.\nSky Sports News reported in September that Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Liverpool are all in the race to sign the England international. Decision time for Guehi awaits.\n\nDaichi Kamada\nSky Sports News reported in October that Palace were eager to keep Kamada beyond the 2025/26 season. The Japan international joined as a free agent in 2024, with the Eagles now at risk of losing him to the same fate next summer.\nInformal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.\nNaouirou Ahamada\nThe 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.\nNathaniel Clyne\nIn his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.\nClyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.\nJefferson Lerma\nLerma is a useful and reliable option for Oliver Glasner to turn to, especially as he looks to balance fixture congestion in domestic cup competitions and Europe.\nThe Eagles hold an option to extend his stay at Selhurst Park for an additional year.\nVitaliy Mykolenko\nMykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.\nJames Garner\nGarner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.\nMichael Keane\nAnother mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.\nKeane, 32, reportedly has an option to extend his stay for an additional 12 months.\nIdrissa Gueye\nGueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.\nThe Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.\nTriggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.\nSeamus Coleman\nThe 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.\nHe has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.\nHarry Tyrer\nTyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.\nDespite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.\nRyan Sessegnon\nThe Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.\nHis importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.\nHarry Wilson\nSky Sports News reported Wilson was the subject of transfer interest from Leeds United in the summer and links for the playmaker will likely materialise again if his contract situation is not resolved.\nFulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.\nAdama Traore\nFulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.\nSky Sports News reported West Ham are interested in signing Traore in January, with Wilson and Alex Iwobi the preferred options in wide areas for Silva.\nRaul Jimenez\nJimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.\nTom Cairney\nClub captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.\nIllan Meslier\nThe 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.\nMeslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.\nAn exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.\nSam Byram\nSigned on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.\nKarl Darlow\nDarlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.\nAlex Cairns\nAcademy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.\nIbrahima Konate\nSky Sports News understands Real Madrid want to sign the Liverpool centre-back for free next summer. Konate's future will likely be impacted by the future of Guehi at Palace, who is also being monitored by both the Reds and Los Blancos.\nAn exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.\n\nAndy Robertson\nThe veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.\nAtletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.\nFreddie Woodman\nWoodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.\nIn the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.\nRhys Williams\nEven with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.\nBernardo Silva\nSilva spoke openly about his future during the summer, outlining he is focused on the season but is aware he can leave the Etihad Stadium next summer.\nHe continues to play a crucial role for Pep Guardiola's side and had options to leave but remained at the club.\nJohn Stones\nThe future of John Stones is yet to be decided, with the England centre-back also approaching the end of his current deal.\nStefan Ortega\nOrtega is now third-choice at the club following the arrivals of Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford. The German shot-stopper was linked as a potential target for Burnley in the summer.\nMarcus Bettinelli\nSigned in the summer before Trafford and Donnarumma arrived at the Etihad, Bettinelli is yet to make his debut for the club.\nHarry Maguire\nOne of the more notable names approaching free agency. Maguire has enjoyed an upturn in his career at Old Trafford over the last two seasons.\nMaguire is not a regular starter under Ruben Amorim but adds crucial depth and experience. A one-year extension in his deal was triggered in January.\n\nCasemiro\nThe club hold an option to extend Casemiro's stay by an additional year but there is a real possibility his contract is not renewed to free up space on the wage bill to strengthen the midfield area next season.\nSky Sports News has previously reported United are prioritising a new midfielder next summer.\nTom Heaton\nThird-choice goalkeeper behind Senne Lammens and Altay Bayindir at the club. Heaton has not featured for United since the 2022/23 season and will be 40 when his contract expires.\nFabian Schar\nSchar extended his contract at the club in April and has admitted he would be open to discussing a new deal with the Magpies, while speaking to The Chronicle in October.\nKieran Trippier\nFollowing an injury to Tino Livramento, Trippier has once again emerged as a key part of Eddie Howe's plans this season.\nThe Magpies boss was asked about the futures of players such as Trippier and Schar in October but did not provide an update on potential negotiations. Sky Sports News reported Monaco were interested in signing the defender in the summer.\nJamaal Lascelles\nThe club captain saw his contract extended late into last season and his future will likely be addressed further down the line.\nEmil Krafth\nKrafth signed an extension in February to keep him at the club until the end of the 2025/26 season. The Sweden international right-back has been rotated into the squad for domestic cup competitions and his agent has downplayed suggestions he could leave in January.\nMax Thompson\nThe 21-year-old goalkeeper is yet to make his senior debut for the club but did impress on loan at Chesterfield last season, keeping five clean sheets in 18 League Two outings.\nMark Gillespie\nLocal-born goalkeeper Gillespie has not featured for Newcastle since the 2020/21 campaign.\nAngus Gunn\nSigned for free in the summer window, Gunn is yet to make an appearance for Forest and is the third-choice at the club behind Matz Sels and John Victor, with the latter starting in cup competitions and featuring in Europe.\nWilly Boly\nBoly signed a new one-year deal at the City Ground last summer but game time is limited with Murillo, Morato and Nikolo Milenkovic ahead of him at centre back.\nDennis Cirkin\nCirkin has been sidelined with knee and wrist injuries since Sunderland returned to the Premier League but recently featured for the U21s as he continues to regain fitness.\nDan Neil\nNeil started all 44 of his appearances in the Championship for Sunderland, but has fallen out of favour since the squad was revamped for the top flight.\nBertrand Traore\nSigned from Ajax in the summer, Traore has struggled to make an impact in Regis Le Bris' high-flying side. Sunderland have an option to extend his deal by 12 months.\nJay Matete\nMatete spent last season on loan at Bolton and has not been included in any of Sunderland's match-day squads this season.\nJoe Anderson\nAnderson has featured once for Sunderland's U21 side so far this season and only made three appearances for them in 2024/25.\nHarrison Jones\nJones has been included in Premier League match-day squads this season and started against Huddersfield in the Carabao Cup. Sunderland have an option to extend the 20-year-old's contract by a further year.\nBlondy Nna Noukeu\nSigned for free from Stoke City on a free transfer in 2024 but has not been included in a match-day squad this season. Sunderland do have a club option to extend his stay.\nSimon Moore\nMoore was included in the match-day squad in the Carabao Cup but is currently third-choice at the club behind Robin Roefs and Anthony Patterson.\nBen Davies\nDavies has featured four times for Wales this season but is yet to take to the field in a Tottenham shirt.\nThe 32-year-old is the longest-serving senior player in the squad and has spoken openly about his future, claiming it was \"not under his control\" while speaking to football.london in August.\nYves Bissouma\nOne of Thomas Frank's first decisions after being confirmed as head coach of Tottenham was to axe Yves Bissouma from the squad to face PSG in the Super Cup final for disciplinary issues.\n\nBissouma has not featured for Spurs this season due to an initial knee injury and then an ankle problem picked up on international duty in October.\nNegotiations over a new deal, after signing from Brighton in a deal worth up to £35m in 2022 and failing to live up to the price tag, seem unlikely.\nCallum Wilson\nWilson has found starts hard to come by since joining the Hammers in the summer but a goal after starting in the 3-2 win against Burnley could ignite his career in east London.\nGuido Rodriguez\nWest Ham have an option to extend Rodriguez's contract but he has been used sparingly by new boss Nuno Espirito Santo, making one appearance off the bench.\nAndrew Irving\nThe midfielder has failed to make a position in the starting line-up his own under the new boss, with his future at the London Stadium now in question as he enters the final few months of his deal.\nGeorge Earthy\nEarthy spent last season on loan at Bristol City, making 38 appearances across all competitions, but has been limited to a role with the U21s since returning to West Ham.\nLukasz Fabianski\nGame time looks limited for the 40-year-old goalkeeper, who is behind both Alphonse Areola and Mads Hermansen in the pecking order. A back injury has also sidelined him since October.\nKi-Jana Hoever\nHoever signed an extension running until 2026 before joining Ligue 1 side Auxerre on loan last season but is now approaching the end of that deal.\nWith Wolves' place in the top-flight now at risk, his future will likely be decided further down the line.\nMatt Doherty\nDoherty rejoined Wolves on a free transfer from Atletico Madrid in 2023, signing a three-year deal, and continues to play a role for the struggling Premier League side.\nIt is likely another future that will be addressed when there is more clarity on which division Wolves will play in next season.",

        "title": "Phil Foden could play as No 9 for England or as Harry Kane's 'accomplice', says Thomas Tuchel",
        "content": "Thomas Tuchel would have \"no problem\" playing Phil Foden as England's central striker should Harry Kane be unavailable after the Manchester City forward's surprise 'false nine' appearance against Serbia.\nJust after the hour mark, Foden replaced England captain Kane and impressed as the No 9 - setting up Eberechi Eze's 90th minute goal in the 2-0 win, while creating another chance for the Arsenal forward, who hit the bar.\nMuch was made about England's lack of back-up striker options to record goalscorer Kane in this Three Lions squad for the November international break, but Tuchel believes he has another option in his deck.\n\"It's absolutely an opportunity,\" said Tuchel about whether Foden would get a chance in that role if anything happened to Kane.\n\"If Phil stays in his shape and form, I have no problem [playing him as a No 9]. I have some other options in mind that I do not want to discuss in public.\n\"Don't forget we have Ollie Watkins and [Danny] Welbeck, [who are maybe] more No 9s, also different options to Harry.\n\"We have many options but it will maybe be about who is in shape, what we have in the squad and how we share the minutes, who we play and what we expect from the match.\"\nAsked if Foden could even challenge Kane for a spot if he continues his fine form for City, Tuchel replied: \"Well, it's a big ask to challenge Harry at the moment - he's in the shape of his life. The attitude, the work rate, the quality and the finishing ratio is just out of control, out of his world.\n\"But even here, maybe [for Phil] to be an accomplice together with Harry and to share some minutes in decisive matches.\n\"I had the idea several months ago, because I played against him in these kind of positions, I had the feeling in the Premier League he was really, really tough with his little movements, counter-movements, little runs. City were so dominant in these little positions, in the pockets, the half-turns. And he was shooting, he played a one-two, and he did a little run off the ball and assisted, so you couldn't catch him.\n\"When we made the long list with 50, 60 players, of course, it's outstanding quality, and I was hoping he might have come from first camp and then he had a difficult spell at City.\n\"And now he has come back for City, he has played actually a deeper role, almost like as an eight. So let's see where this is all going, but I wanted to see him close to the opponent's box, I wanted to see him in the middle of the traffic, surrounded with a lot of players.\"\nSpeaking after the game, Foden admitted that he \"did well\" in that role and hopes the position change could bring the best out of him in England colours.\n\"I thought I did well, created a few chances and unlucky not to put a couple away,\" he told ITV Sport. \"Overall, I have to be happy with the impact.\n\"I'll play wherever the manager puts me. I can play multiple positions and I was happy to come on as a false nine. I enjoyed it. Maybe it will get the best out of me, only time will tell.\n\"There are quality players all over the pitch. I know there is pressure on me to perform at Man City and I just have to keep my head down and earn my place. The smile is back.\"\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz at Wembley:\nThomas Tuchel's tactical nous came out at Wembley.\nWith England struggling in the first 25 minutes, he moved Kane deeper, pushed Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford even more behind him and three minutes after a touchline tactical time-out, the Three Lions were ahead.\nBut seeing Foden come out as a false nine showed how complex Tuchel can go in his pursuit of success.\nFoden turning out in that role is not actually a surprise. He indeed has played there before for Man City - his 1,056 league minutes for Pep Guardiola's side over the last four years add up to nearly a dozen 90-minute games.\nTuchel also mentioned the possibility of Foden as a No 9 in his pre-match press conference.\nThe issue that Tuchel has is with Kane dropping deep and Foden naturally a midfielder - where is the threat in behind from the central striker?\nSome will point to the wide areas being an area for that - Saka and Eze scored against Serbia for example - but it makes England's game plan more one-dimensional. For all of England's success in this group, they have not scored their opener before the 20th minute.\nYes, in some qualifiers they were up against low blocks, which slows down the start to matches, and still managed to be 3-0 up at half-time. There was the early dismantling of Wales, but they were foolishly bold against this Three Lions attack at Wembley.\nBut England will face better opponents - and better defences. They need something different off the bench. Tuchel namechecked Watkins and Welbeck as more natural No 9 options who can be used as wildcards.\nAnd if he can get that 'Plan B' centre forward conundrum right via Foden and one other, he is one step closer to getting his England squad complete.",

        "title": "Cristiano Ronaldo sent off in Portugal's loss at Republic of Ireland in 2026 World Cup qualifying",
        "content": "Republic of Ireland boss Heimir Hallgrimsson has said he may have got into Cristiano Ronaldo's head after he received a red card which could rule him out of Portugal's first two World Cup group games during Thursday's qualifier in Dublin.\nThe 40-year-old was dismissed in the second half for elbowing defender Dara O'Shea with his side already trailing 2-0 at the Aviva Stadium, a day after Hallgrimsson had urged Swedish match official Glenn Nyberg not to allow him to referee the game.\nRonaldo will serve a minimum one-game suspension, meaning he will definitely miss Portugal's final qualifier against Armenia on Sunday, but the nature of the dismissal could trigger a three-game ban, according to FIFA rules.\nRonaldo spoke to Icelander Hallgrimsson pointedly as he made his way off the pitch. Asked afterwards what he had said, Hallgrimsson revealed: \"He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee.\n\"It was his action on the pitch that cost him the red card. It had nothing to do with me - unless I got into his head.\"\nAsked further if he had spoken to the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star after the final whistle, Hallgrimsson added: \"No, I think we spoke enough when he came off.\n\"There was nothing to speak about. This was just a moment of a little silliness from him, I would say.\"\nRonaldo said earlier this week that next summer's World Cup will be his last major tournament before he retires.\nIreland were already in the driving seat when Ronaldo's 59th-minute rush of blood effectively ended their chances, his swinging arm prompting VAR official Pol van Boekel to send Nyberg to the pitchside monitor before he upgraded the yellow card he had initially awarded to red.\nPortugal boss Roberto Martinez said: \"The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games - I think that just deserves credit - and today, I thought it was a bit harsh because he cares about the team.\n\"He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed and obviously when he tries to get away from the defender…\n\"I think the action looks worse than what it actually is, I don't think it's an elbow, I think it's a full body, but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow. But we accept it.\n\"The only thing that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth is at the press conference yesterday, your coach was talking about the aspect of the referees being influenced, and then a big centre-half falls on the floor so dramatically at the turn of Cristiano's body.\"\nRonaldo's dismissal at the Aviva Stadium means that he will definitely miss Portugal's final qualification tie against Armenia due to serving a minimum one-match suspension.\nHowever, the nature of the red card means that the forward could be hit with a three-match ban.\nIn FIFA's Disciplinary Code, Chapter 2, Article 14(i) says that if a player is sent off for \"assault, including elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting or hitting an opponent,\" they should serve a three-game ban.\nIn that case, Ronaldo would miss Portugal's opening two World Cup group stage games should they top Group F, as the suspension would carry over to the tournament.\nIf they were to drop to second in the group and qualify through the play-offs, Ronaldo would then be available for the start of the tournament even if his suspension was extended.\nA decision on the length of the Portugal captain's ban will be made by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee.\nIf Ronaldo was the villain, ex-Tottenham striker Troy Parrott was Ireland's hero, heading home from close range after 17 minutes and then beating keeper Diogo Costa at his near post on the stroke of half-time to seal a victory which ranks alongside previous famous wins over the Netherlands, then world champions Germany and Italy.\nHowever, his contribution was only made possible by the green wall Ireland built to prevent Ronaldo and his team-mates from repeating their 1-0 win in Lisbon last month.\nThe AZ Alkmaar forward told RTE : \"It's the best night I've ever had in my whole life, I have no words to describe it.\"\nIreland would have been out of contention for second place in the group had they lost after Hungary's earlier 1-0 win in Armenia, and they still need to beat Hungary in Budapest on Sunday if they are to remain alive in the campaign.\nMeanwhile, Portugal knew a win would have been good enough to secure their place at next summer's tournament, but the defeat means that the Nations League holders will now have to beat Armenia on Sunday to secure their place at the 2026 World Cup.\nElsewhere, France booked their tickets to North America as a Kylian Mbappe double helped Didier Deschamps' side overcome Ukraine 4-0 at the Parc des Princes.\nMbappe scored either side of Michael Olise's goal before Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike rounded off the scoring to ensure that Les Bleus confirmed their place, having made it to the final in each of the last two World Cup's.\nEarlier, Erling Haaland continued his incredible goalscoring form as Norway demolished Estonia 4-1 to all but secure their qualification.\n\nFour goals in 12 second half minutes, two coming from the Manchester City striker, put Stale Solbakken's team in command and leave them on the brink of qualifying.\nNorway would have secured their passage had Italy failed to come out on top against Moldova . However, late goals from Gianluca Mancini and Francesco Pio Esposito meant that the Azzurri delayed what appears to be the inevitable.\nNorway will travel to Italy for their final qualification game, with the hosts needing to win and produce a 17-goal swing in order to leapfrog the current Group I leaders.",

        "title": "Iman Beney: Young Manchester City forward has made big impact since summer transfer - her form could be key to WSL title chances",
        "content": "Iman Beney has come a long way since having to travel three hours to attend training sessions as a 12-year-old in native Switzerland.\nA standout performer at last summer's Euros, the 19-year-old is now the Women's Super League's latest breakout star, helping to lift Manchester City to the top of the table, a point ahead of Chelsea.\nAndree Jeglertz's side have won each of their last seven league matches, their longest winning streak since 2023. Swiss youngster Beney has become a key contributor, earlier than perhaps even she anticipated, following injuries to Kerolin and Lauren Hemp in the first part of the season.\nPerformances for Euros host nation Switzerland in the summer hinted at her readiness. She might be surprised by how easily she's acclimatised to the standard of the league but Jeglertz was clearly convinced of her talent, singling out her \"calmness and confidence\" recently.\nHe has elevated expectations further by saying: \"Both her and I need to find out how to get even more out of her\".\nSpeaking to Beney herself at City's training ground this week, she shows composure and poise far beyond her teenage years. She tells me how she learnt to \"live like a professional\" from the age of 12, and from then on her desire to make football a career was by her own determined design.\n\"When I was 12, I was part of the Swiss academy and we were living like professionals,\" she says. \"It was at this time I was like 'this is the journey of a pro player'. It was then I knew I wanted it.\n\"My dad knows everything about football, and what we needed to do to become professionals. It was easier in a way. He told me I needed to make sacrifices and that's really important\".\nBeney comes from a footballing dynasty. Her father and auntie both played professionally while her brother is a winger for Primeira Liga club Famalicao, with sibling rivalry a big part of her earliest drive to succeed. \"We had competition when I was young, he pushed me,\" she says of brother Romeo.\nDespite her relatively modest demeanour, Beney's playing style is best encapsulated by boldness. Shortlisted for the 2025 Golden Girl award - won by Michelle Agyemang - she's already come up clutch in big moments, netting the winner in a 3-2 victory over Arsenal and the equaliser as City came from behind to beat Liverpool in October.\n\n\nShe can wriggle out of tight spaces with inconceivable ease. It's something Jeglertz relies on to maintain control in games. \"It's been easy to integrate,\" she continues. \"When I signed I was thinking 'maybe I will have some minutes', but it's been much more\". Beney has clocked three goal contributions in four starts, with City the league's top scorers overall.\nIt's difficult to be a difference maker in a team so flush with attacking talent. The Switzerland international has managed it in a short space of time and added another layer of variety. Collectively, City's forwards have found the net 15 times this term, at least six more than any other side's attacking contingent.\n\"We start the season so well and have a good team where players can be missing, but it just means others are important,\" she says, speaking to City's depth. \"This is important if you want to win a championship.\" She's right.\nManchester City have won seven of their opening eight games, and are the first team other than Chelsea to start a matchday as the WSL leaders this far into a season since the penultimate weekend of the 2023/24 campaign. That was 78 weeks ago. Saturday's Manchester derby is all the more important against that backdrop. To concede points would inevitably hand momentum back to Chelsea.\nBeney will have an important role to play in keeping City's foremost rivals at bay. And, by similar token, ensuring City's title hopes remain on a smooth course.\nFollow coverage of Man City vs Man Utd from the Etihad on Saturday in our dedicated live blog on web and app; kick-off 1.30pm.",

        "content": "\nMan City vs Man Utd, Saturday, 1.30pm\nSomething in the air changes when you're top of the pile and after Chelsea's draw at Arsenal last weekend, Man City have turned from the chaser to the chased.\nNow we find out how serious their title credentials are with the pressure already rising and as they take on the final of their realistic competitors for the league crown, as well as their cross-town rivals, and the side with the second-tightest defence in the division.\nBut collectively, Man City's forwards have found the net 15 times this term, at least six more than any other side's attacking unit.\nAndree Jeglertz's style is less about pretty football - City's predominance in the past - and more geared towards results. City still play a possession-based style but it's less focussed on passing opposition sides into oblivion.\nThey are down in every passing metric this season compared with last. Average possession, sequence time in open play and pass frequency have all dropped. And yet City are more fluid, comfortable winning the ball in deeper areas and attacking at pace.\n\"We will miss passes, but we hunt the ball back,\" Jeglertz told his side at half-time when trailing to Everton last week. They won the game 2-1 with goals scored by Viv Miedema and Bunny Shaw. A predictable pair. City's frontline is firing, and while it continues to function in that way, they are a fearsome prospect.\n\nHowever, Marc Skinner's side have taken points off Chelsea and Arsenal this season. If they can navigate this latest test, the feeling that this might be the year the WSL trophy leaves west London will really begin to grow.\nSkinner could do without a must-not-lose game immediately after an embarrassing home defeat by Aston Villa last weekend, because should they leave empty handed they will find themselves seven points off the top of the table. Not insurmountable, but not far off.\nA morale-boosting win over PSG in midweek has set them up well, but this is a different kettle of fish entirely.\nLiverpool vs Chelsea, Sunday, 12pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League\nChelsea stand on the precipice of history. If they win or draw this weekend, they will set a new record for WSL games unbeaten - 34, beating their own previous run of 33 league games without defeat.\nSonia Bompastor told Sky Sports last week that the run is not even on her radar, but it will be an incredible feat nonetheless. Chelsea are a winning machine, although there is one more game to navigate first.\nAdd to that, captain Millie Bright can break the WSL appearance record with her 211th game in the league. The word 'legend' is batted around often, but that certainly applies to the Blues captain. She remains a consistent performer for Chelsea as well.\n\nLiverpool will be boosted by their first WSL point last weekend. Gareth Taylor has been a thorn in Chelsea's side too - he has been the manager in two of their last four league defeats, and was in charge the last time the Blues failed to score in a WSL match.\nThis, of course, was with Man City, but Taylor has the know-how to beat Chelsea - not many do. Whether his players can execute the plan is another story, with the Blues looking unstoppable.\nTottenham vs Arsenal, Sunday, 2.30pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League\nIt's rare for Arsenal to find themselves level on points with Tottenham heading into a north London derby. Sunday's hosts have a miserable record against their rivals, only winning one of 11 meetings. Last season the Gunners won this fixture 3-0.\nBut times are changing. Spurs' spark has been reignited by new boss Martin Ho and his all-action style of football. They have won three of four on home turf, and actually registered more wins overall (five) than Arsenal have managed this term - only five points shy of their total points tally for last season. Things are looking up.\nSpurs play fast and direct. In many ways it's the antithesis to Arsenal's approach, which is far more methodical and intricate. Both can work as long as the shoe fits, but it's this clash of styles that makes this meeting at this particular juncture interesting.\n\n75 per cent of the total goals Spurs have conceded in the WSL this season have come across just two games. They shipped five alone to Manchester City. And here's the crux. Ho's side have won all five games against teams in the bottom half of the table, but lost all three encounters with teams in the top half.\nIt's a striking comparison, and Ho's biggest challenge if he wants to turn what was previously a middling team into something much greater.\nAston Villa vs London City Lionesses, Sunday, 12pm, live on Sky Sports Mix\nAfter a shock, though not undeserved, win at Man Utd last weekend, it's back to the bread and butter for Aston Villa, but a game which will go further to determining which end of mid-table they finish with a game against one of the teams around them in London City.\n\nVictory would leapfrog them above their opponents and into sixth, and with a game in hand over fifth-placed Tottenham would have them in a solid position to mount a charge to unseat Spurs too.\nThey could have an easier draw than Sunday's opponents, however, who have a perfect record against anyone outside of last season's top four.\nJocelyn Precheur's side do have the second-leakiest defence in the division and when facing the fourth-lowest scorers, which of those is better fixed will have a big say in who goes on to win.\nBrighton vs Leicester, Sunday, 12pm, live on Sky Sports+\nDespite their pre-season turmoil, Leicester have stabilised somewhat under Rick Passmore. The next area of improvement is their away form.\nThe Foxes are without a win in their last 20 WSL games on the road (D7 L13) and could set the longest winless away run in the history of the competition this weekend - they are are currently level with Yeovil Town.\nAnd Brighton are strong at home. The Seagulls have lost just one of their last five WSL games on their own patch (W3 D1) - although that defeat did come in their most recent, which was a 3-2 loss to Man Utd.\nThe game will be played at the Amex Stadium as Brighton look to boost their own season, which is failing to hit the same heights of the last few years.\nWest Ham vs Everton, Sunday, 12pm, live on Sky Sports+\n\nIn the eighth game of the WSL season, West Ham finally registered their first point of the campaign against Leicester. They also beat Southampton 5-0 in the midweek League Cup game to give them another boost in confidence.\nA home game against Everton could be the perfect time for more points too. The Hammers were strong at Victoria Road last year, and have won three of their last four WSL home games against Everton (L1), keeping a clean sheet in four of their last five.\nThe Toffees themselves are not out of reach from the relegation spot, having not won since the opening day of the season at Liverpool, and are in need of points. It will be an intriguing to see if either can snatch the advantage.",

        "title": "Gareth Ainsworth on recovery from heart surgery: The next step is getting back in the Gillingham dugout",
        "content": "Gareth Ainsworth is back involved with Gillingham after several weeks away recovering from heart surgery.\nThe Gills boss is not quite ready for a return to the dugout, yet. But he has been back overseeing training and their preparations for games in League Two. He missed all four of their league fixtures in October.\n\"It is great to be back here,\" he tells Sky Sports . \"This is who I am and it is a special club. They have looked after me and really supported me through what was a very testing time for me, my family and the team. Things are getting slowly better day by day, but I am still not on the touchline yet, which is the final hurrah for me.\n\"I still have to do my management from the stands, but I am doing the pre-game talks, the half-time talks and many decisions from up there.\n\"I was involved in the strategies and the team selections to start games, but I let [my assistant Richard Dobson] and the staff do the rest on matchdays. I was a minute behind on the streams and it is really tough trying to make a substitution from 80 miles away.\n\"It is frustrating, but good to be back. What I think I am missing is the energy I project onto the pitch when I am next to the boys and they can see me heading and kicking every ball with them, but that will come.\"\nAinsworth was having a routine health check in September with the League Managers Assocation (LMA) when they discovered he had a heart murmur.\nIt was a fairly routine procedure, and the Gills boss says it was a resounding success. But he wants to raise awareness to ensure everyone who can to get regular checks.\n\"The great thing is I am all fixed and have a great heart now,\" he says. \"It was a valve issue and they managed to sort my own valve out, so there is nothing artificial. They said artery-wise and heart-wise everything is great, so I just need to let it heal. It is not every day you have a heart operation, so I have given it time.\n\"I do not think you can take that touchline energy out of me. The surgeon and the people at the Spire in Southampton were fantastic. They said they know I have a stressful job and that I get involved, and to just be careful and use common sense.\n\"I get out of breath now and again and I get a good amount of sleep. I want everyone to know how important those checks are. If anyone has a check coming up, go for it and listen to them. They have potentially saved my life. Something nasty could have happened. I thank everyone, the LMA, the club and the surgeons for getting me right again.\n\"I was pretty good with perspective anyway. I have been through a lot in life and in football. Football is the most important of the unimportant things. Health, family, friends and loved ones are everything.\n\"We get carried away and swept up in the tidal wave of emotion, results, performances and strategies. Sometimes it is great to sit back and ask if we are okay. I had so many messages from managers and fans. It was refreshing and it is nice to sit back and look at yourself.\"\n\nAinsworth was involved at Bristol Rovers last Saturday as Gillingham secured their first league win in six attempts. He was sat in the stands with the club's technical staff.\n\"It was more emotional than watching on the sofa because you can feel it,\" he says. \"The fans picked me out in the gantry and started singing my name. Some of the players looked up and gave a fist pump because we were due a win and they knew where I was.\n\"I cannot help but get emotional. That is how I live my life and how I live my life on the touchline, which is probably why I need to stay off it for a while. This game has given me so much, but it has also given me some big operations and major scares. I would not change it for the world.\n\"The doctor is probably fed up with me asking the same three questions: can I go back in the gym, can I go back singing or can I get on the touchline. All three are a few weeks away and I am not sure which order they will come in.\n\"The band has taken a back seat, as it always does when I am in football management. We had a great year when I was out of work and played a lot of gigs, but they have taken even more of a back seat now because of the heart situation. Never say never though. We will be gigging again.\n\"Right now it is about getting a result on Saturday and then the next step is getting back on that touchline.\"",

        "content": "Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor has confirmed goalkeeper Hannah Hampton will be out for a few weeks with a quad injury.\nBompastor revealed Hampton could be sidelined for the rest of the year, meaning she could miss England's games against China and Ghana.\nThe Lionesses' No 1 was absent from Chelsea's 6-0 win against St Polten in the Women's Champions League having picked up the injury during the controversial 1-1 draw with Arsenal.\nShe will not be travelling with the Blues squad for their trip to Liverpool on Sunday, live on Sky Sports .\n\"Hannah won't be here,\" Bompastor said. \"She picked up a quad injury.\n\"She will be out for a few weeks.\n\"We'll see if we will see her before the end of the year but I'm not sure.\"\nIt is not the first time that Hampton has been sidelined this season, having been forced to miss England's 2-1 defeat to Brazil in their first game since retaining the European Championship in the summer.\nKhiara Keating replaced Hampton that night and could well do so again come the international break at the end of November. Swiss international Livia Peng will likely continue to fill Hampton's position at club level, having started in the win over St Polten on Tuesday.\nAnalysis from Sky Sports' Callum Bishop:\n\"When one door closes, another one opens.\n\"The injury to Hannah Hampton is a bitter blow for the young goalkeeper, who recently found herself in the unwanted spotlight following comments made by former England team-mate Mary Earps.\n\"However, it gives a chance for others to come out of the shadows and step up to the plate.\n\"Peng made an ideal start filling in for Hampton, keeping a clean sheet in the 6-0 victory over St Polten. But sterner tests are to follow.\n\"Assuming the England star is indeed out until the end of the calendar year, Peng will have to deal with both Barcelona and Wolfsburg, where she will likely need to replicate Hampton's summer heroics to give Bompastor's team the best platform for victory.\n\"It also presents another chance for Khiara Keating to prove she's the next in line for the Lionesses.\n\"The 21-year-old made her international debut in the defeat to Brazil during the last camp. That gives a strong indication that she will get the nod when China and Ghana visit.\n\"If Sarina Wiegman gives her that vote of confidence, it will be a chance to show her worth in the relatively unpressured environment of an international friendly, and the opportunity to remind Wiegman she does not want to be an understudy forever. Much like Hampton proved when usurping Earps in the England team.\"",

        "title": "England: Thomas Tuchel's World Cup plans are becoming clearer - but big decisions remain in key positions",
        "content": "Thomas Tuchel said he liked England's \"intense\", \"tight\" 2-0 win over Serbia - and the game may prove to be an important 90 minutes as he shapes his plans for the World Cup.\nThe qualifier didn't exactly grip the supporters inside Wembley throughout the contest, with the lack of away supporters not aiding the atmosphere. But on the pitch, there were further signals of how Tuchel's England will look at next summer's World Cup.\nStill, though, questions remain - and big questions, given the calibre of player who could be left at home…\n\nThere was a surprise on the team sheet on Thursday, with Morgan Rogers retaining his place at No 10, despite the return of Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden to the England squad.\nThe Aston Villa ace injected impetus to a slow-starting England and clearly carries favour with Tuchel off the back of repeated eye-catching performances in the role this autumn. This wasn't his most impactful display, though.\nBellingham replaced him after an hour and looked like a man with a point to prove. There were some errors in his play as well but, as Serbia searched for the goal they needed for their own World Cup qualification prospects, space opened up for the Real Madrid star and he played a part in a flurry of late chances. He finished with a more impressive highlights reel from the night, no doubt.\nTuchel's headline-grabbing comments about Bellingham over the past six months have fuelled narratives around the pair's relationship. But his reintegration seems inevitable... although Cole Palmer's return to fitness will add some more complexity to the equation.\nWhether Foden is still a competitor for that position is another question…\n\nYou could argue whether England play with a No 9 at all anymore, given how deep Harry Kane dropped to build up the play against Serbia and it was certainly the case for the last half-hour that Foden was operating as a false nine.\nTuchel wants the Man City technician in central areas \"surrounded by traffic\" to make connections with his short and clever passing.\nA question in the post-match press conference asking whether Foden could displace Kane was given short-shrift by Tuchel but he did say the 25-year-old could be the England captain's \"accomplice\", replacing Kane when he tires or if something different is needed to open up a defence.\nIt's an intriguing development - and potentially not a positive one for the likes of Ollie Watkins, Danny Welbeck, Ivan Toney or any other No 9 who had hoped to be Kane's understudy at the World Cup. Tuchel picked Kane as his only striker in this squad. Perhaps Foden is the alternative.\nAnthony Gordon or Marcus Rashford? That's the question at left-wing - despite Eberechi Eze's stunning goal at Wembley. While Eze could retain the role of impact player from the bench, it looks like a battle between Gordon - a high performer during the Tuchel era - and in-form Rashford for the starting spot in that position.\nPerhaps Tuchel will go horses-for-courses and alternate Gordon and Rashford depending on which opponents England face at the World Cup. But certainly it feels like Jack Grealish or any other left-winger has an almost impossible task to dislodge those two by next summer.\nBehind them, left-back feels like a more open contest. At the start of the year it was Myles Lewis-Skelly. Now, with the Arsenal man short on game time for his club, Man City's Nico O'Reilly has stepped in, with what Tuchel called a \"fantastic\" debut. O'Reilly didn't look out of place in a Three Lions shirt.\nDjed Spence and Reece James - in his more usual right-back role on Thursday - are among a list of other options which includes Newcastle trio Dan Burn, Tino Livramento and Lewis Hall. Watch this space.\nThe big winner of the autumn internationals has been Elliot Anderson. The Nottingham Forest midfielder has made the step up to international football look so straightforward and has almost immediately emerged as the player England have been craving in that position deeper than Declan Rice.\nHe impressed again against Serbia, with his incisive passing coupled with another clean sheet. And with Adam Wharton only given a five-minute sub appearance - his first outing under Tuchel - the signs are positive for Anderson.\nIt's worth noting, Jordan Henderson came on for Declan Rice, with the experienced Brentford midfielder seemingly seen by Tuchel in that No 8 role, rather than Anderson's spot.\nBut the team selection in Albania on Sunday will be interesting. Could that brief runout for Wharton at Wembley be related to plans for a bigger role for him in Tirana? Now seems like the moment Tuchel has to look at the Crystal Palace star in his system.\nAlex Scott's call-up could also be another indication Tuchel has not completely locked-in Anderson. Bournemouth's Scott was left out of the matchday squad on Thursday but his inclusion for the camp shows Tuchel is still looking at options.\nIt's a wise move, in case anything should happen to Anderson. And as Tuchel said in his pre-match media appearances, form and fitness can still have a bearing on his plans. But those ideas are now taking shape - and there don't appear to be many spots left for outsiders to fight for.",

        "content": "Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham are monitoring Antoine Semenyo ahead of the January transfer window.\nThe forward signed a new contract in the summer amid interest from a number of clubs, including Spurs and Manchester United.\nSemenyo has continued to impress other teams with his performances for Bournemouth this season. Only Erling Haaland (11) and Igor Thiago (8) have scored more Premier League goals than Semenyo (6) this season.\nIt follows on from a return of 11 league goals last year for the 25-year-old, and bids when the new window opens cannot be ruled out.\nContrary to reports, however, Semenyo has not asked to leave and is believed to have been annoyed by those claims.\n\nNo move materialised for Semenyo in the summer as United signed Bryan Mbeumo and Spurs signed Mohammed Kudus, so Semenyo signed a new five-year Bournemouth contract until 2030.\nSpurs are looking at signing another forward in January, particularly one who can play on the left, while Liverpool and City are also thinking about new forward options in the long term.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports earlier this month, Semenyo said he is not oblivious to the speculation around his future, but revealed he was glad he remained with Bournemouth in the summer .\nAhead of the Cherries' defeat at Manchester City, the winger spoke to Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp, and was quizzed about his future.\n\"I don't think about it too much,\" Semenyo said. \"I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused.\n\n\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.\n\"When they [his former team-mates] all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club.\n\"But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year. How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well.\n\"I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment.\"",

        "title": "Darren Bazeley exclusive: Meet the former Watford, Wolves, Walsall player leading New Zealand into the 2026 World Cup",
        "content": "Darren Bazeley has been to many youth World Cups.\nWith the New Zealand U17s, he went to Nigeria 2009, Mexico 2011 and United Arab Emirates 2013.\nWith the U20s, he went to New Zealand 2015, South Korea 2017 and Argentina 2023.\nNow, he is just a matter of months away from leading the All Whites into the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico - their first since 2010 and only their third in history.\nIt has been quite the journey for the 53-year-old from Northampton, who made almost 300 appearances for Watford between 1989 and 1999.\nHe later played for Wolves and Walsall and, after leaving the latter in November 2004, was invited to the other side of the world by former Saddlers team-mate Danny Hay, who had been appointed captain of the newly-formed - and now defunct - New Zealand Knights.\nAccompanied by his wife and two daughters, Bazeley made the trip, open-minded.\n\"I just fell in love with the place straight away,\" the one-time England U21 international tells Sky Sports .\n\"As a family, we'd always planned to probably move somewhere with the sun and the beach, somewhere probably in Europe - and then when we came here.\n\"They offered me a contract, it all worked and we decided to jump and move across the world back in 2005. The girls were five and seven at the time, so it was a good time to move, but it's a long, long way - I don't think you can get any further away!\n\"We settled pretty quickly - it's a beautiful country to grow up and live in.\n\"We became permanent residents after a couple of years and then got our citizenship done pretty quickly. We call ourselves New Zealanders now. This is home for us.\"\nBazeley - who speaks with the twang you would expect of a man that has spent two decades in the country - retired in 2008, after a spell at Waitakere United, who are also no longer in existence.\nHe had already dipped his toe into coaching during his playing days at Watford, where there was \"a real ethos of players giving back\", but it was not long before he started to think about forging a career on the other side of the touchline.\n\"When I finished playing up in Auckland, I got a job pretty quickly with, I suppose what you'd call the local FA as a development coach, and I was coaching local teams as well\n\"Funnily enough, we were based in the same building as New Zealand Football and after about a year, I got asked if I would help out with the New Zealand U17s, who were training locally, two or three times a week.\n\"In 2009, that team qualified for the U17 World Cup and, because I'd been helping out, the coach [Stephen Cain] asked if I'd like to come to Nigeria and help out as an assistant coach. I jumped at that, stayed in the programme and, the following year, became the official assistant coach.\"\nWhen fellow Englishman - and current Thailand head coach - Anthony Hudson took charge of the senior team, he implemented alignment with the U17s and U20s, which saw Bazeley begin to work with the All Whites for the first time.\nThat took him to the 2017 Confederations Cup and the intercontinental play-offs for the 2018 World Cup, with a 2-0 defeat to Peru prompting Hudson's resignation. He took the job at Colorado Rapids, and Bazeley followed as his assistant.\nVia a stint in Australia as assistant to former Wales international Carl Robinson at Newcastle Jets, Bazeley was back in New Zealand by October 2020. The aforementioned Hay - then All Whites head coach himself - appointed him as assistant and U20s head coach for a second time.\nThere was a review and a restructure following the failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. Hay did not reapply for his job and, after a spell as interim head coach, Bazeley was given the role on a permanent basis. \"It's been an amazing journey,\" he says.\nHe led the team out in his own right for the first time in Auckland on March 23 2023, before a 0-0 draw with China.\n\"It was something maybe I thought I'd never be in that position to do,\" Bazeley adds.\n\"I'd been involved with the team for a long time and standing for the national anthem - which I've done now maybe 140 times across the different age groups - is always an amazing moment.\n\"I was so proud to it for the first time.\"\nThere have been 26 more games since then, of which New Zealand have won 12 and drawn six.\nIn only two of the other nine games have they lost by more than a two-goal margin - 4-1 away to Sweden in June 2023 and 3-0 to Mexico in Pasadena, California in September 2024.\nBazeley respectfully plays down the ease with which his side qualified for next year's World Cup.\nThey beat Tahiti, Vanuatu, Samoa, Fiji and New Caledonia to take Oceania's only guaranteed spot - and did so by scoring 29 goals and conceding only one.\n\"They are different challenges,\" he insists.\n\"We were heavy favourites, we had all the possession, we had all the chances and we scored goals. But we knew that was a job we just had to do to be able to put us on that next platform. A new chapter started in June with games against Cote d'Ivoire and Ukraine.\n\"The hard thing for us as a national team is we don't get many international teams that come and travel to New Zealand to play, so most of our games are away from home, which makes it tough with performances and results. But over the last few years, we've been growing.\"\nNext up is a friendly against Colombia - ranked 13th in the world - at Inter Miami's Chase Stadium on Saturday. Three days later, they face 23rd-ranked Ecuador at New York Red Bulls' Sports Illustrated Stadium.\nOnly two of Bazeley's squad for those games play in their home nation - Francis de Vries of Auckland FC and Alex Rufer at Wellington Phoenix. Veteran striker Kosta Barbarouses is at Western Sydney Wanderers in Australia, along with Storm Roux, who is at Central Coast Mariners.\nOtherwise, the bulk of the players are based in Europe, including six who play in the Sky Bet EFL and two in Scotland.\nHow does he keep track?\n\"I've got a really good analyst who's able to get video footage of pretty much any player in the world and he puts together really good seven or eight-minute video packages for me, so I can watch all the action and know what they're doing.\n\"I watch a lot of football. Every weekend, I'm watching the Premier League, Championship, MLS, plus I'm watching the A-League. We've got players in France, Norway, Denmark, Serbia, Holland, Scotland, USA.\n\"I don't get to travel too much, but if we're touring in Europe, I'll try and tag on games before or after so I get to see quite a lot of the environments.\n\"Last year, we were in Europe and, the week before, we watched Reading and Nottingham Forest, Marko Stamenic when he was at Red Star Belgrade, then Liberato Cacace when he was at Empoli.\n\"We don't have hundreds of players - we track 50, 60 players around the world - so when we pick squads, we're pretty consistent with selection and what we have is this cohesiveness.\n\"A lot of our players grew up together, they've got this bond and this understanding and this team camaraderie. They're so connected when we come together. That's something we maybe have that's a little bit different to a lot of other national teams.\n\"Because we've got so many players that don't live here now, when we get together in international camps, we spend a lot of time connecting them back to New Zealand and the culture.\n\"We've got some really good young players that have played together for the last four years and are going to stay together for the next 10 years in the national team, which is amazing for New Zealand moving forward.\"\nOne of those who will not be in the USA this month is Chris Wood, who misses out with a knee injury.\nBazeley lights up with the mention of New Zealand's all-time top scorer, with 45 goals, who needs just one more cap to bypass Ivan Vicelich's record of 88.\n\"From a New Zealand point of view, this might be something that maybe never happens ever again, having a striker who has scored 20 goals in a Premier League season.\n\"He's such a great lad, so humble and a real Kiwi. He's so passionate about playing for his country and has helped put New Zealand football on the map. He is so loved.\n\"It's funny because I don't think people really grasp what he's actually achieved. I think people still don't quite realise how global the game of football is, but it's changing.\"\nNew Zealand will find out their opponents and schedule for the World Cup on Friday December 5, when the draw is made in Washington DC.\nA first ever win in the competition is, naturally, high on the agenda - but Bazeley, and all of those around him, wants more.\n\"We want to go to the World Cup to do something. We're not just there to attend. We want to qualify for the knockout phases,\" he says.\n\"To do that, we know we're going to have to beat teams that are ranked in the top 30, top 40 in the world. We've started being able to compete, but we need to take that next step and win, so beating the Ivory Coast was big.\n\"While we know it was just a friendly, that gives everyone the belief we're heading in the right direction and we can compete with, and beat, better-ranked teams.\n\"Everything we're doing on a daily basis is going towards that first win. We've got a great campaign plan that we've put together and everything we do is now looking towards achieving that result.\n\"We try not to waste any time, any moments. It's about making sure, when we get to the World Cup, we're ready to go and perform and achieve what we want to do.\"\nBazeley may have worked at six youth World Cups, but he has never worked at the World Cup.\n\"I've been watching World Cups since I was six years old - it's the biggest event in the world and we're going to be there.\n\"If I'm honest, I'm not sure if it's really hit home yet that we're going to be on that global stage. It's exciting and I can't wait.\"",

        "title": "Celtic manager search: Columbus Crew boss Wilfried Nancy given permission to speak to Hoops over managerial vacancy",
        "content": "Columbus Crew have granted permission for their boss, Wilfried Nancy, to speak to Celtic over their managerial vacancy.\nIt’s understood the Hoops have already held talks with his representatives and believe he is open to joining the Scottish champions.\nNancy, 48, is due to have direct discussions with the Celtic hierarchy over the weekend.\nSky Sports News revealed on Wednesday that Celtic officials had been holding talks in London with a number of targets and their representatives, after drawing up their shortlist.\nPrincipal shareholder Dermot Desmond was meeting interim boss Martin O’Neill in London on Friday to discuss whether he would stay on if the club were unable to appoint a new manager before the end of the international break.\nCeltic’s aim is to have a new boss in charge for their game at St Mirren next weekend, but would like O’Neill to continue for a bit longer if they can’t strike a deal with one of their top targets. As Sky Sports News revealed last week, Celtic are pleased with the way O'Neill has galvanised the squad and lifted the mood at Celtic Park.\nIn the last two years, Nancy has won the MLS Cup and Leagues Cup as well as being named MLS Coach of the Year. He also took Columbus Crew to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final last year.\nAlso among the names on Celtic's radar are Wales boss Craig Bellamy, Club Brugge's Nicky Hayen and Ferencvaros manager Robbie Keane.\nCeltic had been keen to explore a potential return for Ange Postecoglou - but Sky Sports News understands that interest will almost certainly not progress at this time.\nWhen asked about a potential move to Celtic at Columbus Crew's end of season press conference, Nancy refused to rule himself out of contention.\n\"I'm not here to talk about myself. I'm here to talk about the team, first of all,\" Nancy said.\n\"And I have nothing to say about any kind of reports.\"\nNancy guided Columbus Crew to seventh in the MLS Eastern Conference during the 2025 season, but was eliminated over three games by second seed FC Cincinnati in the first round of the play-offs.\nCurrent interim boss O'Neill admitted that he did not know if he would be in charge of the Hoops by the time they face St Mirren live on Sky.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster in an interview conducted on Thursday and broadcast on Friday morning, the 73-year-old said: \"The short and honest answer is I genuinely do not know.\n\"I am not party to anything that is happening with the board talking to prospective clients and things like this, nor do I want to be because that's never been a remit of mine.\n\"The gentlemen involved can very easily make up their own minds about people without me interfering in any aspect. I said that I would do it until they found that replacement.\n\"And is that possible for next week? I genuinely do not know. My job was to come in and hold the fort, and the minute that someone is appointed, I will step aside.\n\"And if it was tomorrow, I would gladly step aside. It's not a problem. It's nothing to do with any sort of ego or anything like that. It's just to help out in the very, very short term.\"",
