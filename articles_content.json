        "title": "Xavi Simons to Tottenham: RB Leipzig goals and assists show pedigree - Spurs might need to build the team around him",
        "content": "Xavi Simons moving to Tottenham represents an exciting addition to the Premier League. This is a player long regarded as one of the top young talents in Europe – and he showed glimpses of that ability despite it being a more difficult season for RB Leipzig.\nThere are those top-line numbers. Ten goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga, even as Leipzig missed out on Europe for the first time since their elevation to the top division. He ranked in the top 10 for goals from open play and big chances created.\nBut it was another statistic, the fact that Simons also ranked among the top 10 players for possession won in the final third, that really cuts to the heart of what can make him so good. The scatter charts below highlights just what a rare combination that this is.\nIt is why Simons remains so attractive. Thomas Frank and Tottenham have been eyeing a No 10 all summer, pursuing Morgan Gibbs-White even before James Maddison suffered a serious injury. They have energy in midfield but combining that with craft is the key.\nThere are some gifted players around, individuals able to provide that spark, but finding those capable of doing the work out of possession, playing at high intensity, is difficult. They are at a premium. Simons has demonstrated that ability from the outset.\nJavier Rabanal, his coach at PSV, did not know what to expect when a teenage Simons turned up in Eindhoven on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. Despite his reputation as a child prodigy, he had made only a handful of senior appearance for the French club.\n\"Nobody really knew ,\" Rabanal tells Sky Sports . \"But what surprised us, at first, was his capacity to defend, to press after the ball was lost. He was really aggressive going after ever lost ball. He wanted to be the first to press, to really put all his energy into it.\"\n\nRabanal attributes that to Simons' background - and it is a cosmopolitan one. A Netherlands international, partly of Surinamese descent, he moved to Spain as a child and was part of Barcelona's famed La Masia academy long before he was a teenager.\nHe was eventually snaffled away from Catalonia by PSG but those principles of pressing were already ingrained. \"This is something that is really appreciated at Barca,\" explains Rabanal. \"He was so aggressive. Everybody recognised him as a potential top talent.\"\nThat season at PSV was pivotal in his career, leading to him winning his first caps for the Netherlands. Rabanal recalls the 2022 Johan Cruyff Shield game against Ajax in front of 52,000 in Amsterdam when he scored to seal a 5-3 win. \"He was really dynamic.\"\nRabanal, assistant coach to Ruud van Nistelrooy that season, adds: \"It was against Go Ahead Eagles away that he scored two goals [in a 5-2 win] and after that he started playing. He was in the team all season, as a winger or inside as a No 8 or a No 10.\"\nThere was an assist for Fabio Silva \"with the outside of the foot\" that stood out as particularly special. Then there was the final game of the season away to AZ Alkmaar when PSV needed a result to be sure of qualifying for next season's Champions League.\n\"Xavi scored twice even, the second of them when we already playing with 10 players. That goal showed what he was all about because he could have gone down but he preferred to score than fall.\" He got his goal to finish as joint-top scorer in the Eredivisie.\nSuch performances earned him a loan move to Leipzig, where he scored eight goals in his debut season and impressed enough for the German club to make him their club-record signing midway through the last campaign, even as the team was faltering.\nSpeaking to Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's sporting director, he described Simons as \"one of the best players in Europe\" and it was easy to see why the player saw it as the right move at the time. Leipzig have a reputation for a high-intensity brand of football.\n\"He was very clear about his personal career plan.\" Ironically, paying a fee for Simons that could have risen north of €80m with performance-related add-ons was a deviation from Leipzig's long-held strategy. They overstretched and it changed Simons' plan.\nThe result is that even at 22 this is a player whose own ambitions can no longer be matched by Leipzig - and this is where the opportunity comes for club and the player. Spurs offer Champions League football. He offers creativity in the final third.\nHe has already shown his quality in different environments and in different positions. On the pitch, he is an asset in and out of possession, a scorer and a creator. \"He scores goals but he is not selfish,\" says Rabanal. \"If he has the chance, he wants assists too.\"\nOff the pitch, his desire to leave Leipzig is unlikely to raise too many alarms at Tottenham. \"He is a really professional worker, doing the extra work in the gym, the extra work with his own physiotherapist,\" adds Rabanal. \"He is always focused on playing football.\"\nIf there was a concern at Chelsea, it was that Simons is a talent who benefits from the team being built around him and that would not be possible with Cole Palmer around. At Tottenham, there is a vacancy for a match-winner. Xavi Simons could be that man.",

        "title": "Alejandro Garnacho transfer news: Chelsea close to agreeing deal to sign Manchester United winger",
        "content": "Chelsea are close to agreeing a deal with Manchester United over the signing of Alejandro Garnacho.\nA compromise over Garnacho's valuation is set to be reached. United valued him at £50m - which was more than what Chelsea were prepared to pay.\nThere is increased confidence that a deal can be completed before Monday's Deadline Day.\nGarnacho has turned down offers from other clubs because he wants to move to Chelsea.\nThe winger was told he could leave United at the end of last season and he is not training with their first-team squad.\nSpeaking earlier this summer, United boss Ruben Amorim felt Garnacho is still a talented player but says things have not worked out for the 21-year-old academy graduate at Old Trafford.\n\"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out,\" said Amorim during United's tour of the USA for the Premier League Summer Series .\n\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.\n\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"\nAmorim also revealed that sales this summer are important because he wants a smaller squad this season, given United are not in Europe and will only fight on three fronts.\n\"I'm really happy with the team,\" said Amorim. \"Without European competitions, I want a small squad so everyone feels really important.\n\"If you have a lot of players, you have one week to prepare and a lot of players are going to be out, and then in training they will be frustrated and then the quality of the training will drop.\"\n\nMan Utd are expecting offers for midfielder Kobbie Mainoo amid growing interest from home and in Europe.\nThe 20-year-old is understood to be open to leaving, but has not transmitted that stance to the club yet.\nMainoo was an unused substitute in United's opening two Premier League games. United are happy with Mainoo and are not actively looking to let him go - and at this stage, they are very unlikely to consider a loan.\nNapoli will hold more talks with United as they look to finalise a deal for striker Rasmus Hojlund .\n\nTwo other clubs - one from England and one from Germany - made late enquiries for Hojlund. But he wants to go to Napoli. He is ready to travel to Naples once the clubs can agree on the move.\nUnited will do a deal, but on their terms. Both United and Hojlund want a guaranteed permanent element included in any deal.\nNapoli's initial proposal was a loan with an option - the option would become mandatory depending on certain conditions being met based on appearances, goals and Champions League qualification.\nDiscussions between Real Betis and United over Antony have been described as positive and there is a cautious optimism a deal will finally be struck.\nAfter spending the entire window trying to do a straight loan, Betis are working on a deal that will have a mandatory element attached, be that an initial loan or a straight permanent deal.\nUnited have made it clear from the outset that they will not accept another loan move. There is a strong will from all parties to strike a deal before Deadline Day.\nWinger Jadon Sancho is exploring his options. A number of clubs are interested in the 25-year-old. Roma are desperate to sign him, but, as it stands, he doesn't want to go to the Serie A side.\n\nUnited's preference is a permanent deal. However, with just five days to go, another loan cannot be ruled out. Sancho has entered the final year of his contract - United have the option to extend for a further 12 months.\nInterest from clubs in Europe is growing in United defender Tyrell Malacia . At this stage, a loan move is the most likely outcome. Malacia has entered the final year of his contract.\nMainoo , meanwhile, is not a Chelsea target. The Blues asked about him in January but they have since moved on.\nFermin Lopez is a player who has been on Chelsea's radar for a long time and they are prepared to make a move if they were to receive any encouragement from Barcelona or the attacking midfielder.\nMeanwhile, Nicolas Jackson will only be allowed to leave Chelsea in a permanent move or a loan plus an obligation to buy.\nBayern Munich and Aston Villa want Jackson and there are expected to be more developments when Alexander Isak's future at Newcastle United is resolved.\nJuventus have registered their interest in Jackson, but they are currently pressing ahead with trying to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain instead.\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Antoine Semenyo: Man arrested following alleged racist abuse towards Bournemouth forward during Premier League opener at Liverpool",
        "content": "A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been arrested after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused during the first game of the Premier League season, Merseyside Police said.\nThe force said the man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence and has been taken into custody to be interviewed.\nSemenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator to referee Anthony Taylor, who stopped play in the 29th minute on Friday and a 47-year-old man was ejected from Anfield.\nSemenyo was also subjected to racist abuse on Instagram on Friday night. The 25-year-old shared some of the abuse on his story, with the caption: \"When will it stop?\"\nMeta has told Sky Sports News it is investigating. It is understood the social media company are removing comments and disabling the offending accounts.\nSemenyo said the response to the incident showed football at its best \"when it mattered most\". The incident was strongly condemned by representatives of both teams, while the Premier League has said it will launch a full investigation.\nWriting on social media on Saturday, Semenyo, who scored two goals before Liverpool claimed a 4-2 win, said: \"Last night at Anfield will stay with me forever - not because of one person's words, but because of how the entire football family stood together.\n\"To my Bournemouth team-mates who supported me in that moment, to the Liverpool players and fans who showed their true character, to the Premier League officials who handled it professionally - thank you. Football showed its best side when it mattered most.\n\"Scoring those two goals felt like speaking the only language that truly matters on the pitch. This is why I play - for moments like these, for my team-mates, for everyone who believes in what this beautiful game can be.\n\"The overwhelming messages of support from across the football world remind me why I love this sport. We keep moving forward, together.\"\nIn a statement released on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"It has been a depressing start to the season as racist incidents quickly stack up. Although this might appear symptomatic of the current climate right now, clubs have shown this week there is no tolerance for this type of behaviour.\n\"But that is only made clear when authorities move swiftly and decisively to hold offenders to account. Football must remain firm in standing up to every incident of discrimination this season and be transparent about its collective actions so that everyone can see how effectively this is being tackled.\"\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola were spoken to by referee Taylor when the incident at Anfield occurred, leading to the game being paused.\n\"I am told via the Premier League Match Centre that Antoine Semenyo was the subject of a racist comment from the crowd,\" reported Sky Sports' Peter Drury at the time on commentary.\nSky Sports' Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher called the incident \"despicable,\" with Neville saying: \"It overshadows what should be an amazing night; the first day of the Premier League season, a beautiful day, and that boy has [reported being] racially abused.\n\"It's despicable. However, it has happened. It will keep on happening. It's a sorry state.\"\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes football has to continue to try to educate the next generation about racism.\n\"The only thing we can do is deal with it by dealing with him personally and try to educate the next generation,\" Van Dijk said. \"That is the only way to try and kick it out, in my opinion.\n\"I can't believe it. These things shouldn't happen but unfortunately it does and it is an absolute disgrace in my eyes.\n\"First and foremost these things should never happen in the world, not only football. But in general racism is not of this world in my opinion, but if we are to be realistic, unfortunately, it still exists and that is the painful side of it.\n\"We have to deal with it in the here and now.\"\nVan Dijk offered words of support to Semenyo, adding: \"I am here for Antoine, whenever he needs it and we are here as a club to deal with it in the best way possible because it shouldn't happen.\n\"But we stand with him completely.\"\nMerseyside Police said after the game: \"Merseyside Police will not tolerate hate crime of any form. We take incidents like this very seriously, and in cases like this we will be proactively seeking football banning orders, with the club, against those responsible.\"\nThe incident came two days after Tottenham's Mathys Tel received racist abuse online after missing a penalty in his side's Super Cup win against Paris Saint-Germain.",

        "title": "Newcastle look blunt without Alexander Isak as West Ham's Graham Potter sinks to a low - Premier League Hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nJamie Carragher hit out at Liverpool's \"unbelievable\" and \"absolutely shocking\" defending in their 4-2 win over Bournemouth - saying they will not retain their Premier League title if they continue with those standards.\nLiverpool won on an emotional night at Anfield thanks to late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah - but they were given a real scare by the Cherries as Antoine Semenyo's quickfire double cancelled out goals either side of half-time by Hugo Ekitike and Cody Gakpo.\nBoth of Semenyo's goals saw Liverpool caught out on the transition - with Bournemouth's second goal seeing the young forward run nearly the length of the pitch before finding the bottom corner.\nCarragher also hit out at Ibrahima Konate, who he felt was responsible for poor defending for both goals.\n\"It is unbelievable,\" said Carragher on Friday Night Football . \"It's fantastic from Semenyo - but Liverpool have had this problem.\n\"How many players were ahead of the ball - maybe eight players - when they were winning 2-1? That can't happen. It's absolutely shocking at this level.\n\"For Semenyo to run that far and get his shot away is incredible - but where Konate is going? He had a really poor night tonight at centre-back.\"\nArne Slot was right post-match. \"It was a great game to watch\", he declared. \"This is what fans want to see.\"\nThis was everything a Premier League opener should be about. Entertainment, high intensity, comebacks and throwbacks. Exquisite goals as well as the rough and ready kind. It had the lot.\nAnd therefore, the fact it has been tainted by one senseless act of alleged racist abuse from a so-called fan at Anfield is especially disappointing. What should be celebrated, however, is Semenyo's response to that idiocy.\nHe gave Milos Kerkez and, latterly, Andy Robertson the runaround, scoring with two of his three shots on target, from an expected goals value of just 0.89. His performance was a triumph of talent and resolve and shows exactly why he had so many clubs interested this summer.\nThe fact Bournemouth have tied him down to a new five-year deal is a massive coup and also reason for optimism moving forward. Laura Hunter\n\nNewcastle presented a united front after their goalless draw with Aston Villa. Eddie Howe described their performance as \"magnificent\". Anthony Gordon and Dan Burn talked up their togetherness and team spirit in difficult circumstances.\nA point at Villa Park represents a positive result but they would likely have been celebrating all three had Alexander Isak been available. Their star striker, training on his own as he continues to hold out for a move to Liverpool, was sorely missed.\nIsak, scorer of 23 Premier League goals last season, would doubtless have buried one of the first-half chances that fell to his team-mates. The game was a reminder of his importance. Newcastle have failed to win any of their last six Premier League games without him. They have not even scored in the last four. Their shots were worth 1.43 expected goals at Villa Park but they failed to capitalise.\nHowe improvised in Isak's absence, using Gordon centrally with Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga either side. \"I really like it,\" said Gordon of his new role afterwards. \"As my career progresses, I think I might end up more central.\"\nHe had his moments. Most notably with the run in behind to force Ezri Konsa's red card. But overall this was another reminder of the huge task Newcastle will face to replace Isak if he does go. With fans turning against him, it is a reality they may soon have to confront. Nick Wright\nLapses in concentration have now cost Aston Villa in back-to-back games.\nOld Trafford against Manchester United in the last game of the 2024/25 season and now the opener in the 2025/26 campaign. Two red cards for two key players.\nVilla had just gathered momentum in the fixture following the restart. Boubacar Kamara went close with a header and Ollie Watkins rifled his shot directly at Nick Pope.\n\"The red card changed the game,\" Emery said in his post-match press conference.\nHe was right. Anthony Gordon darted behind the defence and was racing through on goal, leaving Ezri Konsa with little choice other than to drag the makeshift forward down.\nVilla did well to gather themselves after that incident, but last season showed how costly dropping points could prove to be.\nBefore Konsa's challenge, it looked like Emery's side were gathering real momentum and could go on to win the fixture.\nIt is by no means a disastrous start to the season for Villa but securing that first win now gets harder.\nThey travel to Brentford for their next fixture and will need to call upon their only other centre-back off the bench, Pau Torres, to play alongside fellow left-footer Tyrone Mings. Patrick Rowe\n\nErling Haaland scored 22 Premier League goals last season and was deemed to have had a disappointing campaign. He scored two on the opening day at Wolves and still didn't make the headlines.\nSuch is his scoring prowess, it is taken for granted. But make no mistake: his fitness and form remains a key ingredient in Manchester City's recipe for success.\nPep Guardiola's side look like they will be in the title mix this season, reinvigorated by the class of Tijjani Reijnders and inspired by the magic of Rayan Cherki. But Haaland was perfectly placed to tuck in their opener and his firm finish for the third indicated he is sharp.\nThe striker was blunt with his assessment of City's underperformance last term but while new stars have created a buzz, Guardiola is relying on Haaland to hit the extraordinary levels we've seen from him in the past. He's off to a good start. Peter Smith\nWolves have been tipped to have a difficult season ahead and a 4-0 home defeat certainly didn't quash those predictions.\nHowever, losing to Manchester City is not a reliable barometer to how Wolves will perform against the majority of Premier League sides and boss Vitor Pereira was keen to remain positive afterwards. \"We committed a mistake, they scored,\" he said of City's finishing, while talking up his team's approach to the challenge.\nHowever, he also admitted he is hoping for three or four players 'at least' before the transfer window closes and there's no doubt a side shorn of the magic of Matheus Cunha needs a spark.\nWhether that can be found in the market remains to be seen - and could dictate the direction of Wolves' season. Peter Smith\n\nSuggestions were made about an exit plan for Richarlison this summer. The forward only managed four league starts for Tottenham last season and 500 minutes in total. His four goals were indicative of a campaign blighted by injuries, with form impossible to come by as a bit-part player under Ange Postecoglou.\nBut this version of Richarlison, fully fit and firing, is altogether different. He finally looks ready to live up to the promise of a No 9, buoyed by Thomas Frank's trust to play the starring role ahead of Dominic Solanke.\nAn impressive double in Tottenham's 3-0 win over Burnley hinted at a player rejuvenated. It's hard to imagine a more perfect start for new boss Frank, with summer addition Mohammed Kudus providing both assists for Richarlison to deliver two special goals.\nThe forward has only teased his quality since arriving in north London from Everton back in 2022. Many questioned his £60m price tag. They were right to. But if this latest performance is a sign of things to come, excitement should swiftly replace the apathy. Laura Hunter\nAfter Burnley's defeat to Spurs, Scott Parker admitted their defeat was born out of the ruthlessness of the Premier League.\n\"It's the Premier League as well and one of the biggest learnings from today, is the clinicalness you have to be at, how quick you have to get your shot off,\" Parker said.\n\"You don't have a lot of time in the Premier League, obviously, against world-class players, athletes, physically. And that's the ruthlessness of the Premier League, all concentration, keeping attention constantly, because the game at any moment can turn.\"\nBurnley, despite showing promise during phases of the game, were bettered by a clinical, savvy and physical Spurs side.\nIn the early stages of the second half as they chased an equaliser, Hannibal Mejbri's hesitance on the ball meant that chance went begging. Burnley were their architects of their own demise on the day. Maxime Esteve gave away the ball for and Tottenham opened the scoring within 10 minutes.\nA lost duel, minutes after conceding the second, led to a third as Burnley appeared to crumble. It's a lesson Parker's side will have to learn from quickly as they mount an attempt to remain in the top flight. William Bitibiri\nSunderland are the great unknows of this Premier League season.\nHow would they cope with the step up?\nHave they changed too much too soon from the Championship promotion-winning team? Would all the new signings fit in?\nEarly signs are though they could be just fine this season and it was one of the 'old guard' that impressed most.\nDan Ballard, hero of the play-off semi-final win over Coventry, rose to the occasion once again. He was a colossus. A rock. He was consistently in the right place at the right time to fend off West Ham's attacks. No player on the pitch won more duels (10) or made more clearances (8).\nHe was like Concorde - commanding the skies with his dominant aerial ability, showcased by his fantastic headed goal, one of four shots he had in the game. Big things could be on the horizon for Ballard and Sunderland this season. Lewis Jones\nWe all know what Graham Potter's teams can do in the Premier League - his Brighton team was exceptional and tactically ahead of their time. His stock was at its highest there. It's now at its lowest with questions to seriously answer about whether his football can thrive at West Ham.\nThere's a bit of identity crisis at the club.\nPotter wants to make them more possession-orientated and tactically flexible but the success West Ham under David Moyes was all about defensive organisation and creating big moments in transition. Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paqueta - West Ham's two most potent attacking players - are at their best with space to roam into. They look cramped and restricted playing in this current style. It's testament to Bowen's ability that he continues to be their star man. He didn't deserve to be on the losing side.\nPotter needs to find a solution. Lewis Jones\n\nOn the face of it, there was always going to be late drama between Brighton and Fulham. Rodrigo Muniz's late equaliser means there have been four goals scored after the 79th minute in the last three encounters.\nFor Brighton, however, there was a familiar story. Another lead dropped, another missed chance. Twenty-two points were dropped from winning positions last season. Add two more to the Fabian Hurzeler era.\nBrighton's performances under the German have been brilliant - the eighth-placed finish for the 32-year-old was under-rated in terms of Premier League achievements last season. Imagine how good they would be if they can hold on to a lead?\nBut if owner Tony Bloom wants to see his dream of being in Europe every season - then his players will need some backbone. Sam Blitz\nCarlos Baleba had been strongly linked to Manchester United this week, but he was outshone by another young gem after 25 minutes.\nIt was only Josh King's second Premier League start but the 18-year-old was doing rings around the Brighton midfielder. He was Fulham's biggest threat and the player making things happen throughout.\nThe teenager combined well with Fulham's key player from last year, Alex Iwobi, down the left, with King's directness, comfort on the ball and aggressiveness in the duels a reason why he started over the available and more experienced options of Emile Smith Rowe and Andreas Pereira.\n\"He's a top talent player and I didn't have any reservations to start with him,\" said Marco Silva. But the Fulham manager cannot rely on an 18-year-old for attacking inspiration.\nMore signings are needed - with Fulham yet to make an outfield purchase this summer. Rodrigo Muniz is wanted elsewhere and even if he stays, seven out of his last nine Premier League goals have come as a substitute. Fulham need more players like King to make the difference from the off. Sam Blitz",

        "content": "The job of a modern Premier League manager is to coach the players he has been given.\nLong gone are the days, for better or worse, when Howard Wilkinson would pick up the phone to call Alex Ferguson about signing Denis Irwin only to end up selling Eric Cantona to Manchester United.\nWith that in mind, it has been surprising to see and hear Enzo Maresca speaking publicly about why Chelsea need to sign another centre-back, while admitting they are looking for \"internal solutions\".\nThe way Maresca sees it, Chelsea have to sign someone to cover for Levi Colwill while he recovers from a serious knee injury. The only problem is that Maresca is the Chelsea head coach and he is not in charge of transfer policy.\nWhile he is a brilliant tactician with a proven track record of winning trophies and improving and developing players, he does not have the final say on who Chelsea buy and sell. The people who are in charge of that - Chelsea's football leadership team - may not necessarily share his point of view about signing another defender.\nTheir job is to build a squad of elite players which can cope with every eventuality, including a long-term injury to a key player. Judging by the fact that Chelsea won two trophies last season, including the Club World Cup, and qualified for the Champions League, they - and Maresca - seem to be doing a very good job.\nThat's a view that must be shared by Chelsea's owners, because why else would they extend the contracts of the club's sporting directors and recruitment chiefs on the eve of a new season?\nThe bottom line is that Chelsea feel they have an elite squad made up of the right blend of youth and experience. Recruitment is driven by the sporting team and they have total confidence in the squad they have assembled over a series of windows.\nThey will not sign another centre-back this summer, despite Colwill's injury, and the only way that will change is if a first-team squad central defender is sold in the next fortnight. Renato Veiga and Axel Disasi , who are not training with the first team, are already set to leave, so it would take another departure for Chelsea to consider signing a centre-back.\nChelsea have arguably one of the deepest squads in the Premier League and there are a lack of options of the required standard available in the current market. Another reason why they will not panic buy is that signing another defender just for the sake it would take away chances to play from the club's up-and-coming centre-backs.\nIn any case, Tosin Adarabioyo , Benoit Badiashile and Josh Acheampong are expected to step up to play in Colwill's role and Maresca has 10 defenders in his squad and nine who can play as centre backs, including Jorrel Hato , who moved from Ajax last month.\nTosin, who is a doubt for the Crystal Palace game, is viewed inside the club as an elite defender with great leadership qualities, while Acheampong has the potential to be one of the breakout stars of the season.\nSome seven or eight clubs have already tried to sign the 19-year-old and big things are also expected this season from Aaron Anselmino , who is only one year older. Signing another centre-back could also create problems with the balance of the squad when Colwill returns.\nMaresca must know all this, so why is he speaking in public about wanting to sign another centre-back?\nOne reason could be that he is feeling more emboldened to speak his mind now that he has won two trophies. That is unlikely to work in his favour because Chelsea's recruitment strategy is not going to be driven by what their head coach says in public, no matter how many trophies he wins.\nAnother theory is that he is doing it to lower expectations and take a little bit of pressure off himself and his players before the start of a big season. He did something similar on a few occasions last season when he denied that Chelsea were in the title race and also that he had been given the target of qualifying for the Champions League in his first season.\nPerhaps Maresca is just being honest and trying to give straight answers to straight questions. That makes good copy and is great news for journalists, but in modern football, free speech has become a privilege for employees, not a fundamental right.\nIn\nJamie Gittens - Dortmund, £51.5m\nJoao Pedro - Brighton, £60m\nLiam Delap - Ipswich, £30m\nJorrel Hato - Ajax, £38.5m\nEstevao Willian - Palmeiras, £29m\nDario Essugo - Sporting, £18.5m\nMamadou Sarr - RC Strasbourg, £12m\nKendry Paez - Independiente del Valle, £17.3m\nOut\nKendry Paez - Strasbourg, loan\nDjordje Petrovic - Bournemouth, £25m\nBashir Humphrey - Burnley, undisclosed\nMarcus Bettinelli - Man City, undisclosed\nKepa Arrizabalga - Arsenal, £5m\nMathis Amougou - Strasbourg, undisclosed\nZak Sturge - Millwall, undisclosed\nNoni Madueke - Arsenal, £52m\nCaleb Wiley - Watford, loan\nMike Penders - RC Strasbourg, loan\nJoao Felix - Al Nassr, £43.7m\nIshe Samuels-Smith - Strasbourg\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall - Everton, £29m\nLesley Ugochukwu - Burnley, undisclosed\nMarc Guiu - Sunderland, loan\nArmando Broja - Burnley, undisclosed\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Brentford have completed the signing of forward Dango Ouattara for £42m from Bournemouth in a club-record deal.\nBournemouth were reluctant to sell, but after Ouattara made it clear he wanted to leave, the Cherries had no option but to allow him to go for a price they felt was fair market value, which includes add-ons. He has signed a five-year deal.\nThe transfer surpasses Brentford's previous club-record deal of £30m when they signed striker Igor Thiago from Club Bruges last summer.\nOuattara joined Bournemouth from Lorient in January 2023 and made 88 appearances, scoring 11 goals.\nBrentford head coach Keith Andrews said: \"We're really happy to get Dango in. He's someone that we were aware and surprised could be available and, once we knew that signing him might be a possibility, we really focused on trying to get him in.\n\"We liked his Premier League experience, even at his young age, and he just hasn't found the rhythm yet because of a lack of consistent game time.\n\"He also suits the way we want to play - he has something that we were lacking in the forward line, and he will complement what we already have in the building.\n\"The fans will love him; he's the type of player that they will get off their seat for.\"\nBournemouth are looking at replacements and have Amine Adli of Bayer Leverkusen as a key target.\nSky Sports News' Richard Newman:\n\"The next two weeks are key.\n\"Iraola's Bournemouth squad is not where he hoped it would be.\n\"The defensive unit has changed dramatically - Kepa Arrizabalaga's loan from Chelsea ended without a permanent deal in place, Dean Huijsen's left for Real Madrid, Illia Zabarnyi is now at Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez lined up against his old side for Liverpool on Friday night.\n\"Some reinforcements have come in from France - Adrien Truffert and Bafode Diakite, but it's obvious there's hope there will be more.\n\"It's an unsettled period for a head coach who has Bournemouth going places, having achieved a record Premier League points tally last season when finishing ninth.\n\"But Iraola's record shows he can usually be trusted to have a plan, and the club's transfer policy is admired, so it may be that the Cherries boss will have to stay 'patient' as he put it, and all the pieces will fall into place before the window closes.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

During his two seasons at the club, the 21-year-old played 82 times and scored 14 goals.\n\"I'm really excited to be here and can't wait to get started,\" said Hutchinson. \"I've played at the City Ground a few times and it's always felt like a hostile atmosphere, so I'm looking forward to playing here with the fans behind us.\n\"I'm going to give it my all and I'm looking forward to the challenge as it's a new chapter for me, but I feel ready.\"\nMcAtee scored seven times in 34 appearances for his boyhood club Manchester City.

        "content": "Newcastle manager Eddie Howe says the \"door is well and truly open\" for Alexander Isak's return - despite fans directing their anger towards the wantaway striker.\nIsak was left out of the squad for Saturday's Premier League opener at Aston Villa as he seeks a move away from the club and his absence was keenly felt in a goalless draw where the visitors failed to make their attacking dominance count.\nThe Sweden international was the subject of a rejected offer of £110m plus add-ons from Liverpool earlier in the window, but continues to train away from the first team and remains determined to join the Reds.\nSupporters vented their frustration at the full-time whistle, calling the wantaway striker \"greedy\", and while Howe said the club needed \"clarity\", he insisted that route to reintegration remains open.\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" Howe said when questioned about the latest on Isak's future. \"The door is well and truly open.\n\"He has to decide what he wants to do. We would like a resolution. We need that clarity. You don't need any kind of distraction.\n\"I am not in control of that. There is one person who can control that. Let's wait and see. I have made my stance clear. I am concentrating on the team.\"\nNewcastle supporters could be heard chanting against Isak during a post-match television interview with Anthony Gordon, who played as a false nine in the striker's absence.\n\"It has been difficult because we're a tight-knit group,\" Gordon told TNT Sports. \"But you see today, we've still got that spirit and togetherness.\n\"That will never go, regardless of individuals. We're still together. Things like this can make you better in the end.\"\nAsked later about the chants, Howe added: \"The supporters acted really well today. If afterwards, they want to say something, they are free to do that.\"\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie at Villa Park:\n\"The growing sense of frustration and anger from the Newcastle fans was evident at the end of the game when they sang 'There's only one greedy *******' as the players left the field.\n\"Eddie Howe had asked the fans to back the team. They left it till the end to make their feelings clear.\n\"Howe said afterwards the door is still open for Alexander Isak, and that only one person can give a resolution to the situation, and they need one. However, the strength of feeling from the Newcastle fans would, for me, make it even more difficult for Isak to return.\n\"Could their minds be changed? Time will tell. But I felt watching that today, it was such a sad situation. Newcastle had all their players available, apart from their talisman. With Isak in the team, they would have won.\n\n\"The supporters are upset, they're angry. They don't understand why a player earning £150,000 per week can be so unhappy. They would give their right arm to be the No 9 for Newcastle, and they can't get their heads around why Isak wouldn't want to be, or why he would conduct himself the way he has.\n\"There are young kids with 'Isak 14' shirts everywhere you look in Newcastle. There's fans with Isak tattooed on their arm because he scored in the cup final.\n\"He reduced tens of thousands of them to tears with that goal against Liverpool. Who would have thought that, just a few months later, he would have angered them the way he has?\n\"Where do Newcastle go from here? It's hard to tell. I still think it's 50/50 whether he leaves or not. If he stays, it feels like this circus will carry on and that's something Howe will not want. He said today he's made it perfectly clear what his stance is - he wants Isak back. But he's going to have to do the mother of all man-management jobs on Isak to get him back firing.\n\"If I had been given a pound for every time I had been asked what's happening with Isak, I could have bought him myself.\"\n\nSky Sports' Nick Wright:\nNewcastle presented a united front after their goalless draw with Aston Villa. Eddie Howe described their performance as \"magnificent\". Anthony Gordon and Dan Burn talked up their togetherness and team spirit in difficult circumstances.\nA point at Villa Park represents a positive result but they would likely have been celebrating all three had Alexander Isak been available. Their star striker, training on his own as he continues to hold out for a move to Liverpool, was sorely missed.\nIsak, scorer of 23 Premier League goals last season, would doubtless have buried one of the first-half chances that fell to his team-mates. The game was a reminder of his importance. Newcastle have failed to win any of their last six Premier League games without him. They have not even scored in the last four.\nHowe improvised in his absence, using Gordon centrally with Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga either side. \"I really like it,\" said Gordon of his new role afterwards. \"As my career progresses, I think I might end up more central.\"\nHe had his moments. Most notably with the run in behind to force Ezri Konsa's red card. But overall this was another reminder of the huge task Newcastle will face to replace Isak if he does go. With fans turning against him, it is a reality they may soon have to confront.",

        "title": "James McAtee: Manchester City may regret letting academy product leave after Cole Palmer and Morgan Rogers mistakes",
        "content": "\"I need him. That's why I want to keep him.\"\nPep Guardiola promised a big season - and a big future - for James McAtee when he started him in Manchester City's Community Shield last August. A year later, he is no longer in the City picture.\nThe 22-year-old academy graduate has left to join Nottingham Forest in a deal worth around £30m. Big money for a big talent who just could not find a spot in the squad.\nCity have been here before, though. They had a youngster by the name of Cole Palmer - who had roughly the same number of Premier League minutes in his final City season before leaving for Chelsea. In that similar amount of time, you could even say McAtee's attacking output was better.\nLike Palmer, McAtee did well to find the net in his brief City cameos but was never backed consistently on the biggest stage. The parallels go even further - Palmer was a key player at England's U21 European Championship-winning team in his final summer as a City player. This year, McAtee was captain of Lee Carsley's champions at the same tournament - just two years later.\nGiven how Palmer rose to fame at Chelsea, winning the Premier League Young Player of the Season award in his debut campaign at Stamford Bridge, Guardiola may feel uncomfortable letting another similar type of play go - especially considering what he said about him last summer.\n\"I said to Txiki Begiristain [City's former sporting director] in the beginning of the season, I don't want to loan him or sell him,\" added Guardiola after that Community Shield start.\n\"When you find a player in small spaces that attack the final third, have a sense of goal, it's difficult to find players of this quality.\"\nThat feeling on McAtee is shared by those who developed him. \"Pep always references how good he is in pockets,\" Brian Barry-Murphy, Manchester City's former youth coach and now Cardiff City's new boss, tells Sky Sports .\n\"What's the most significant thing about James McAtee? The tighter the spaces, the more at home and comfortable he is. He's a very specific player in that role.\"\n\nAs City's Elite Development Squad head coach, Barry-Murphy grouped Palmer, McAtee and Oscar Bobb together as three players who could \"do things with the ball that I've never seen before\". Yet the three of them feel or felt like the bridesmaids of Guardiola's affections, rather than the main attraction.\nBobb was tipped for a breakout season in the one just gone before a long-term ankle injury kept him out for nearly the entire campaign. He is back in the fold now but even then, City invested in Savinho for Bobb's right-wing role, highlighting the challenge of trying to break through when the club can just sign the world’s best young players for that area.\nThat is the main issue for City's youngsters. Despite having one of the best academies in the world, they are also blessed with financially strong owners ready to flood the first team with Europe's best talent.\nMcAtee found that out before his departure. Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki were signed in the attacking midfield position this summer for a combined £80m, while even teenage midfielder Sverre Nypan has been invested in that position for a further £12.5m.\nFor City youngsters like Palmer and McAtee, it has created a sink-or-swim surroundings that very few - Phil Foden and Rico Lewis being the only academy examples - have managed to thrive in when it comes to City’s first team.\n\"Because this City team is so dominant and so good, even if it seems like a big step up, you can do well and survive there and do well for a period,\" adds Barry-Murphy.\n\"But then you either come back out or you stay in there and become established. That's the challenge of how actually good you are.\"\nBut Palmer has proved he is good enough, only elsewhere. He is not the only City academy product to do that.\nCity let Morgan Rogers depart for Middlesbrough for just £1m - then watched him move to Aston Villa, who could have taken City's Champions League spot off them. Rogers even scored the winning goal against City at Villa Park last season.\n\nCity also allowed Liam Delap to join Ipswich for £20m last summer; he is now linking up with Palmer at Chelsea. Both of them helped City beat Chelsea to the Club World Cup trophy this summer.\nThe Delap case was a more understandable one. He was never going to outmuscle Erling Haaland out of a City starting spot during his prime years.\nBut the cases of Palmer, Rogers and now McAtee require more justification - especially given how the club will likely have been planning for how to succeed Kevin de Bruyne as soon as the Belgian hit his 30s three years ago.\nSome will justifiably point out that City's academy has been a good resource for doing exactly that: buying the best players in the world.\nLast summer, academy sales hit the £500m total since Guardiola's arrival in Manchester - not just due to selling the likes of Palmer and Co, but also installing substantial sell-on clauses so City would benefit from their next move. City cannot justify signing the best without selling their best.\nBut City's boy infamously became Chelsea's man with Palmer. Delap can do the same next season, adding to what Rogers has already done.\nThere can be huge advantages to having a solid academy, but if enough of them aren't trusted, City have proved that enough of them will come back to haunt you. Time will tell if McAtee is one of those players.\nFrom next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo give Man Utd hope even in defeat to Arsenal - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nAnother Old Trafford defeat. But this wasn't same old Manchester United.\nThere were shoots of hope in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal.\nThey played with sharp bursts of electricity and actually hurt the Gunners from different angles with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo maintaining their Premier League form of last season.\nFinally Ruben Amorim has players in central areas in attack that can cause chaos with their direct running and power.\nCunha ranked top for dribbles (6) and duels (20) whilst everything Mbeumo did was very positive despite being tightly marked for most of the encounter.\nIf they play like that at Old Trafford this season consistently, it could become a tough place for away teams to play. An expected goals tally of 1.59 suggests they were good for at least a goal. No points but a promising start.\nSomething to build on. Lewis Jones\nNottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.\nNuno had referenced a 'lack of options' in his squad midweek, something he doubled down on after an emphatic 3-1 victory. \"The club knows the needs of the squad so we have to be patient and see. The faster they come, the better,\" he said.\nPerhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.\nNew signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.\nStill, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.\nNuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want? Laura Hunter\n\nWhen Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.\nCut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.\nChelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.\nMaresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.\nSome may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.\nUltimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.\nThey will need to recover and get back up to speed quickly, as they visit West Ham on Friday, live on Sky Sports , and the Hammers will be desperate to bounce back after a tough start to the season themselves. Callum Bishop\n\nA goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.\nRaya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.\nHis best moment came in the first half, when he got his fingertips to an angled effort from Matheus Cunha. Even he wasn't sure how he pulled it off. \"I don't know how I saved it to be honest, it was very close to my feet,\" he told Sky Sports afterwards.\nGary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.\nIt was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.\nThere are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation. Nick Wright\n\nIf anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.\n\"I expect him being back and playing for us against Fredrikstad,\" was Oliver Glasner's response when asked by Sky Sports about the 27-year-old's future. But if it does turn out that was the last time Eze is seen in Palace colours, it was another reminder of just how influential he is.\nSince the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.\nHowever, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward. Callum Bishop\nBased on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.\nNo team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.\nAndrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.\nIf the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast. Laura Hunter\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Arsenal's set-piece threat and defensive resilience sees off Man Utd but Mikel Arteta knows they need more",
        "content": "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.\nMikel Arteta called it a \"massive\" result afterwards. \"To go in the first fixture at Old Trafford with that atmosphere, the way they are building momentum, with new signings and excitement around them, it's a great feeling,\" he added to Sky Sports .\nThey did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.\nNo other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.\n\nThey are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.\nEven finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.\nThey were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.\n\"Arsenal are one of the best teams at managing games and knowing how to run the clock down,\" said Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville on co-commentary. \"They are an experienced unit.\"\nTheir experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.\n\n\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.\n\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"\nThe Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.\nThe main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.\n\nThe club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.\nArteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.\nGyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.\nGyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.\nTheir passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.\nArteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.\n\"The sign of a really good team is when you're not at your best and you win football matches,\" said Sky Sports ' Roy Keane. \"The worry for me in the second half is there were opportunities to really go at Manchester United, but they seemed off it from that point of view.\n\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.\n\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"\nWhat matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Newcastle have completed the signing of midfielder Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa in a deal worth up to £43m.\nThe Magpies will pay an initial £39m plus £4m in add-ons for the 24-year-old, who has signed a five-year deal at Newcastle.\nRamsey will wear the No 41 shirt at St James' Park, as he did at Villa.\nThe sale of academy graduate Ramsey represents pure profit for Aston Villa, who have been looking to sell a player to help with their Financial Fair Play (FFP) situation.\nRamsey, who had been a long-term target for Newcastle, had two years left on his Villa contract and departs having scored 17 goals in 167 appearances across all competitions for his boyhood club.\nThe England U21 international is the fourth first-team addition to Newcastle's squad this summer and takes their overall spend above £130m, following the arrivals of Anthony Elanga, Malick Thiaw and Aaron Ramsdale.\nSpeaking as a Newcastle player for the first time, Ramsey said: \"I'm delighted to be here. It's been a mad two or three days, but I'm really happy to be here and I can't wait to get started.\n\"This is a big move for me, but as soon as I knew the gaffer was interested and really Iiked me, it didn't take much time to decide.\n\"His track record of developing players, especially those who have gone on to become internationals here, speaks for itself.\n\"It was always a tough game playing for Villa against Newcastle - the team is full of energy, so athletic and the fans are so passionate.\n\"I feel my game will suit that and I'm excited to be on the other end of it now.\"\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said Ramsey fits the profile of the \"young and hungry\" player he wants to recruit, while also bringing a wealth of Premier League experience to the club after featuring 136 times in the top flight.\n\"Jacob is another fantastic addition to our squad,\" said Howe.\n\n\"His qualities will bring us something different on the pitch and he fits the profile of being young and hungry to develop, but also with a wealth of Premier League football under his belt.\n\"Jacob offers versatility and his directness in attack has proven to be a real threat at this level in recent seasons. He performed very well in the Champions League last season, too, and we believe he'll be a major asset for us.\"\nNewcastle manager Eddie Howe says the \"door is well and truly open\" for Alexander Isak's return - despite fans directing their anger towards the wantaway striker.\n\nIsak was left out of the squad for Saturday's Premier League opener at Aston Villa as he seeks a move away from the club and his absence was keenly felt in a goalless draw where the visitors failed to make their attacking dominance count.\nThe Sweden international was the subject of a rejected offer of £110m plus add-ons from Liverpool earlier in the window, but continues to train away from the first team and remains determined to join the Reds.\nSupporters vented their frustration at the full-time whistle, calling the wantaway striker \"greedy\", and while Howe said the club needed \"clarity\", he insisted that route to reintegration remains open.\n\"Nothing has changed,\" Howe said when questioned about the latest on Isak's future. \"The door is well and truly open.\n\"He has to decide what he wants to do. We would like a resolution. We need that clarity. You don't need any kind of distraction.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Eberechi Eze thought he had fired Crystal Palace into the lead at Chelsea on Sunday with a stunning free-kick, but an unusual law was applied to disallow the goal.\nThe goal would have given the visitors a priceless victory on the opening weekend at Stamford Bridge.\nSky Sports explains why it was ruled out...\n\nChelsea defender Marc Cucurella committed a foul on Will Hughes just outside of the area and Eze blasted the free-kick past goalkeeper Robert Sanchez to put Crystal Palace ahead in the 13th minute.\nHowever, the VAR James Bell spotted that Palace captain Marc Guehi had pushed Moises Caicedo to create a gap for the ball to fly through and, in doing so, had moved too close to the Chelsea wall when the ball was struck.\nReferee Darren England ruled out the goal after consulting the pitchside monitor and announced the decision to Stamford Bridge. He said: \"After review, the Crystal Palace No 6 [Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free-kick and a disallowed goal.\"\nSky Sports' Chris Sutton said on co-commentary that the decision was \"scandalous\" and \"extremely harsh\".\n\nThe IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play. \"If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.\"\nOne similar incident occurred last season, although it went unpunished, which coincidentally was also in Chelsea's favour.\nReece James scored a free-kick to equalise in the 95th minute against Bournemouth in January.\nHowever, two Chelsea players, Marc Cucurella and Tosin, were stood within a metre of the Bournemouth wall. The goal should have been ruled out.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner says the Premier League has to be careful with the law.\n\"I know we have to be one yard away from the wall,\" he said. \"I think maybe we have a situation where we sometimes try to block like everybody's doing. And, obviously, the block started too early.\n\"But the Premier League has to be careful when they disallow these kind of goals. Because I think in every direct free-kick, there are blocks somewhere around the wall. But, of course, we have to accept it because that's the rule.\n\"I was a little bit surprised, because VAR is treated or handled very, very cautiously here in England, which I really appreciate. It's always about supporting the referee's own field decision.\n\"My great team, who is always watching all the set-plays, will watch it again and find a solution so that in the next case it won't happen again that the goal is disallowed, and then we can celebrate and hopefully win.\"\nMicah Richards said: \"There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.\"\nRoy Keane added: \"Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.\n\"Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

Who knows that this is the truth, what is written? There are rumours and so many rumours, and everybody tells somebody something for their own advantage, maybe.\n\"I watch the players every single day in the training sessions. If most of the things that are written about them is true, they couldn't perform like this, the team couldn't be together like this, the team couldn't be committed to each other like they are. It's just not possible.\n\"He was picked because he's a Crystal Palace player and he's a very good Crystal Palace player. He trained the whole week, so there was no reason not to pick him.\"\nGlasner then revealed Eze's £68m release clause has now expired. He said: \"I'm quite calm, but I also know, we have two weeks to go, and I know Ebs' clause is gone, so it's the club's decision, and we will see what happens.\"\nEze has been one of Spurs' top targets this summer. A bid has not yet been made and Palace value him at £70m, with two years left on his contract.\nPalace host Fredrikstad on Thursday in the first leg of their UEFA Conference League qualifying play-off and Glasner expects Eze to be involved again.\nHe said: \"He will come in tomorrow [Monday] to Crystal Palace's training ground, and have recovery. We will ensure a Tuesday off and we will meet Wednesday, and I expect him being back and playing for us against Fredrikstad.\"\n\nSky Sports' Chris Sutton, speaking at Stamford Bridge, contrasted Eze's situation with that of Alexander Isak at Newcastle - where he has not featured for the club, or trained alongside his team-mates, since he announced his desire to leave earlier this summer.\n\"He seems like a good type,\" he said. \"If the situation with Tottenham happens, it'll happen. We've seen the situation at Newcastle with how Alexander Isak has downed tools and isn't the most popular person among the Newcastle faithful.\n\"If you're Oliver Glasner, you want your best players starting.

I'm really proud of the guys. They were really brave in everything they did during the game,\" he told Sky Sports .\n\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home.\n\"We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.\n\"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.\n\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.\n\"We need to win games but that was a completely different game to last season.\"\n\nUnited will look to convert another positive performance into points in their next fixture when they face Fulham, live on Super Sunday , on August 24.\nSky Sports' Roy Keane took an opposing view to Amorim's assessment of the performance, after arguing there is still cause for concern at the club despite the encouraging showing from the new recruits.\n\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is OK with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better,\" Keane said on Super Sunday .\n\n\"It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.\n\"Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Man Utd.\"\nFellow United legend and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville was more upbeat after the defeat, as he focused on the positive performances from Cunha and Mbeumo, as well as other positives that emerged from the loss.\nSpeaking after the game, he said: \"I thought they [United] played well, they were the better team in terms of performance.\n\"We know that performance isn't enough sometimes. Arsenal have got real resilience and can grind out 1-0 victories.\n\"There were some positives. Mbeumo in the first half and Cunha in the second half. They showed they can handle a big game at Old Trafford, they showed they have got the quality and ability. We obviously know that from Wolves.\n\"This is a tough start. Arsenal are a tough team to break down. I'm not too downhearted. I thought the system worked better and the back three did better.\n\"Casemiro and Fernandes did well in midfield; they held their own.

        "title": "Gary Neville says Man Utd need a goalkeeper, but would Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma fit?",
        "content": "Sky Sports' Gary Neville says Manchester United 'unequivocally' need a new goalkeeper despite Ruben Amorim's defence of No 2 Altay Bayindir after his error led to Arsenal's 1-0 win on Super Sunday.\nThe stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.\nDespite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.\nThe game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.\nOn the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.\n\n\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.\n\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.\n\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.\n\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.\n\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.\n\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.\n\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.\n\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.\n\n\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.\n\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.\n\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nMan Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.\nHe told Sky Sports : \"We have players to win any Premier League game.\n\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"\nReflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.\n\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.\n\n\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.\n\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"\nAmorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.\n\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.\n\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…\n\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"\nMeanwhile, Sky Sports pundits Roy Keane and Micah Richards rowed over Bayindir's culpability for Arsenal's winner.\nFormer United midfielder Keane had no sympathy for the Turk, who appealed for a foul, with the Sky Sports pundit saying: \"He has to come with violence, he's got to be aggressive, he's got to be almost saying to players, 'Come in here, I'm happy to deal with it'.\n\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"\nFellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.\n\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"\nThat prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.\n\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.\n\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"\nKeane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

        "title": "Arsenal's slender victory at Man Utd analysed by for Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher in Ref Watch",
        "content": "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher is back for a new season of Ref Watch on Sky Sports News and starts by taking a look at the key incidents from Arsenal's 1-0 win at Man Utd.\nShould Riccardo Calafiori's winning goal for Arsenal have been disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper Altay Bayindir? Should Matheus Cunha have won a penalty after a foul by William Saliba?\nAlso, Dermot discusses all the other major refereeing talking points from the opening weekend.\n\nINCIDENT: Matheus Cunha went to ground in the penalty area after a challenge from William Saliba. Did Saliba get the ball? Referee said no penalty.\nDERMOT SAYS: I wasn't convinced it was a penalty. What I would say is if it is going to be a penalty it's one the referee is going to give. VAR will not get involved in this.\nJay Bothroyd on Sky Sports News:\n\"How is that not a penalty? It's a guaranteed penalty.\n\"If it happens on the halfway line it is a free kick.\n\"Saliba has hit his foot and the ball has gone nowhere. If Saliba isn't there Cunha doesn't go down. It's a penalty.\"\n\nINCIDENT: William Saliba stood in close contact with Altay Bayındır as Arsenal score at Old Trafford - was it a foul?\nDERMOT SAYS: Not a foul. Not a foul at all. If anything the goalkeeper puts his hand on the player.\nJay Bothroyd on Sky Sports News:\n\"He hasn't been strong enough, he's caught out of position and that mistake has cost Man United the game. If he thinks it's a foul, go down, at least you've got a chance of winning a free kick. It's just poor, you need to be stronger.\"\n\n\nINCIDENT: Eberechi Eze free kick disallowed by VAR after Marc Guehi interfered with the wall.\nDERMOT SAYS: This is the law. If a wall is set up with three or more players, opposition players have to be a metre from it. Often you see forwards standing in front of the wall. In this case, Guehi is stood between two players.\nWhere they set up, Guehi initially is not deemed to be in the wall, he's between two players to the right of the wall, but as the ball is kicked, Guehi's movement is towards Caicedo and without doubt, he's not a metre from it.\nYou don't see it often. Most free kicks don't result in a goal, and because this one does, VAR has to check it.\nIt was all about Caicedo moving into the wall and Guehi being in contact with him.\nThe genie is out the bottle now.\n\nMicah Richards said: \"There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.\"\nRoy Keane added: \"Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.\n\"Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.\"\n\nINCIDENT: Senesi avoids punishment after appearing to handle the ball as the last defender.\nDERMOT SAYS: I think this is a really interesting situation. The VAR, for me, has looked at it too quickly and cleared it.\nI think he's seen the ball fly up off Senesi and has not watched the second part.\nHe's seen the ball hit the elbow off the knee and stopped looking, he hasn't looked for the second swipe. If he sends the referee to the screen, the referee has all options. He probably sends Senesi off because Huge Ekitike is going to be away. The only doubt is, is it too far from goal? But this is a class forward.\nIf it goes to the screen he would have been sent off. It was a mistake and fortunately it didn't affect the outcome of the game.\nINCIDENT: Burnley goalkeeper Dubravka gets penalised for holding the ball for more than eight seconds, resulting in an opposition corner.\n\nDERMOT SAYS: If you watch, he does take too long. I get a bit concerned with the eight seconds, because we don't want to have to get the stop watch out. But he's making no attempt to release the ball.\nIt's a deterrent. That's why the rule is there. No referee wants to have to apply that rule, they want goalkeepers to get rid of the ball and keep the game moving faster.\nJay Bothroyd on Sky Sports News:\n\"I don't know why he's holding onto the ball for so long, it's about 12 seconds.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Championship talking points: Wrexham still winless, Lampard's Coventry soar & Sheff Utd slump again",
        "content": "\n\nResult: Wrexham 2-3 West Brom\nWrexham have not been used to losing matches in recent years - but they are certainly not used to losing at the Racecourse.\nIn the three seasons prior to their return to the second tier for the first time since 1982/83, they either won or drew 64 games, losing just five.\nBut it became six in 70 when West Brom turned the game on Saturday lunchtime. Following the opening day loss at Southampton, it was also the first time they had lost back-to-back league games since February 2024.\nThis was the first of four home games in six and Sky Sports Football 's Don Goodman said: \"Home is where the heart has to be for Wrexham. This is where they want to be strong.\n\"They are going to have to find a way to maybe just be a little bit more creative in open play.\"\nKevin Phillips added: \"Is there a mini-crisis starting to happen? They've not had back-to-back losses for two years, so they've got a bit of a battle in front of them now.\"\nWrexham will need the experience of older heads like Kieffer Moore and Conor Coady but boss Phil Parkinson is still hoping for more activity, saying: \"We're looking across the board. We probably do need a couple more players.\" Dan Long\n\nResult: Derby 3-5 Coventry\nIt was, undoubtedly, the game of the weekend in the Championship. Coventry City led early, trailed early in the second half and then bounced back to flummox Derby County with a flurry of late goals.\nIt proved quite the difference for Frank Lampard's side from their opening-day goalless draw at home to Hull City, and hopefully for him proved a sign of what is to come from his side and the impressive attacking options he has at his disposal.\nIt would have also provided him with some minor satisfaction, no doubt, as he claimed a first win in his second attempt on his return to Pride Park.\n\"I thought we were fantastic,\" said Lampard. \"It was a really tough match for us because of the style of Derby which makes it really difficult and I thought we dealt with it brilliantly.\n\"One of the biggest things is that we showed belief at 3-2 down, there was a feeling for me that we could still do something and the players did it so it's one of my favourite games that I've had since I've been here.\"\nFor Derby, meanwhile, it is now two defeats from two and eight goals shipped in that time. No other side in the league has conceded more than five. There is work to do. Simeon Gholam\n\nResult: Sheff Wed 0-3 Stoke\nThe spirit both on and off the field is evident at Sheffield Wednesday, but this was a stark reminder that pluck alone won't be enough for Championship survival.\nThe Wednesday fans marched through Hillsborough Park before kick-off, and their whistle protest had barely begun when Million Manhoef fired Stoke into an early lead.\nThe supporters though stayed right behind the players, directing their anger towards owner Dejphon Chansiri .\nWednesday started the first half slowly, and did so again in the second when Divin Mubama doubled the lead, before Manhoef's second completed the job for Stoke.\nMuch of the focus will be on Wednesday's plight, and Mark Robins won't mind that too much. Stoke were impressive and have won their first two league games of the season for the first time since winning promotion in 2007/08.\nIs Robins the manager to finally break Stoke's curse? Rob Jones\n\nResult: Swansea 1-0 Sheff Utd\nMind the gap? Sheffield United are propping up the Championship with their troubled rivals right now.\nToo early to look at the table? With ominous clouds lingering and questions unanswered after a summer of upheaval, not necessarily.\nUnited look anything but right now after three defeats from three under Ruben Selles, the latest a confused and disconnected display at Swansea that ended with an exchange between star player Gus Hamer and a frustrated away end. The mood is already volatile, with Middlesbrough, Ipswich and Southampton to come before September is out.\nSky Sports wrote ahead of an opening 4-1 thumping by Bristol City that the high-stakes call to replace Chris Wilder was likely to undermine United's promotion prospects.\nThe spine of a team that accrued 92 points last season has been swapped for unproven replacements and while quality remains in attacking areas, the squad is short on depth, physicality and experience. Selles, the lone voice so far amid a sea change that requires structural support, has already called out the recruitment process as \"not good enough\".\nThe new boss needs tangible backing in the transfer market before the deadline.\nSigns of buy-in for his ideas on the pitch must also come soon. Kate Burlaga\n\nResult: Millwall 0-3 Middlesbrough\nIt's been 31 years since Middlesbrough started a league campaign with back-to-back wins, but that changed emphatically on Saturday.\nA 4-0 demolition by Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup midweek meant Rob Edwards' side had a fire in their belly to prove the doubters wrong, and they did just that.\nAfter a first half where there was little to separate the two sides, Middlesbrough came out fighting in the second to take all three points with three goals.\nHayden Hackney opened the scoring with a calm and collected first-time finish following a Morgan Whittaker cross, before Alfie Jones added another in the 87th minute following a corner.\nThings got worse for Millwall in injury time, as Delano Burgzorg sealed the deal with a third. Both sides have their sights set on the play-off spots this season, but Boro fans will be hoping that Edwards can repeat his Luton trick. Harriet Prior\n\nResult: Ipswich 1-1 Southampton\nFor a side that struck 92 goals during their promotion-winning Championship campaign two seasons ago, Ipswich have looked lightweight and lacking in confidence in front of goal as they start their pursuit of a quick return to the Premier League.\nMissing the muscle and ferocity of Liam Delap, who departed for Chelsea this summer, and the creative flair of Omar Hutchinson, who completed his £37.5m switch to Nottingham Forest earlier this week, George Hirst is tasked with leading the line.\nHirst grabbed a last-gasp equaliser from the spot at Birmingham on the opening day of the season, but has been isolated in attack so far this term, especially in the 1-1 draw at home to Southampton on Sunday - a draw that did, however, stop a nine-match league losing streak for Kieran McKenna's men at Portman Road.\nSam Szmodics was the pick of Ipswich's attack against Saints, his waspish style causing problems and, barring the foot of the post, he would have opened his own campaign for the season.\nIt is early days of course and the arrival of forward Chuka Akpom, who was watching from the stands on Sunday after joining on a season-long loan, will give the Ipswich fans hope that the good times - and goals - are just around the corner again.

        "content": "Speaking on Monday Night Football , Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville made their 2025/26 Premier League season predictions.\nGary Neville - Arsenal (but it's too close to call)\nI couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool. I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it.\nArsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.\n\nLiverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.\nCity have an unbelievable spine.\nI went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.\nJamie Carragher - Liverpool, ahead of Man City\nWhat I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.\nA few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.\nI was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.\nNeville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd\nI've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!\nIt was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.\nAnd I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.\n\nCarragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea\nI think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.\nNeville - Nottingham Forest\nFor Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.\n\nNeville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves\nBrentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…\n\nCarragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley\nIt's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.\nNeville - Brentford\nIt will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.\nCarragher - West Ham\nIt wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.\n\nCarragher - Erling Haaland\nMohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.\nNeville - Viktor Gyokeres\nI thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.\nHe's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.\nCarragher - Florian Wirtz\nIt's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.\n\nCarragher - Estevao\nHe's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.\nNeville - Adrien Truffert\nI was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.\nNeville - Ruben Amorim\nThere's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.\nCarragher - Oliver Glasner\nI think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been released on bail following his arrest after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused during the first game of the Premier League season, Merseyside Police said.\nThe man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence and was taken into custody to be interviewed.\nHe has since been released on conditional bail, with enquiries ongoing, Merseyside Police told Sky Sports News.\nAs part of his bail conditions, the man cannot attend any regulated football match in the UK and not go within one mile of a designated football stadium.\nSemenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator to referee Anthony Taylor, who stopped play in the 29th minute on Friday and a 47-year-old man was ejected from Anfield.\nSemenyo was also subjected to racist abuse on Instagram on Friday night. The 25-year-old shared some of the abuse on his story, with the caption: \"When will it stop?\"\nMeta told Sky Sports News it was investigating. It is understood the social media company are removing comments and disabling the offending accounts.\nSemenyo said the response to the incident showed football at its best \"when it mattered most\". The incident was strongly condemned by representatives of both teams, while the Premier League has said it will launch a full investigation.\nWriting on social media on Saturday, Semenyo, who scored two goals before Liverpool claimed a 4-2 win, said: \"Last night at Anfield will stay with me forever - not because of one person's words, but because of how the entire football family stood together.\n\"To my Bournemouth team-mates who supported me in that moment, to the Liverpool players and fans who showed their true character, to the Premier League officials who handled it professionally - thank you. Football showed its best side when it mattered most.\n\"Scoring those two goals felt like speaking the only language that truly matters on the pitch. This is why I play - for moments like these, for my team-mates, for everyone who believes in what this beautiful game can be.\n\"The overwhelming messages of support from across the football world remind me why I love this sport. We keep moving forward, together.\"\nIn a statement released on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"It has been a depressing start to the season as racist incidents quickly stack up. Although this might appear symptomatic of the current climate right now, clubs have shown this week there is no tolerance for this type of behaviour.\n\"But that is only made clear when authorities move swiftly and decisively to hold offenders to account. Football must remain firm in standing up to every incident of discrimination this season and be transparent about its collective actions so that everyone can see how effectively this is being tackled.\"\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola were spoken to by referee Taylor when the incident at Anfield occurred, leading to the game being paused.\n\"I am told via the Premier League Match Centre that Antoine Semenyo was the subject of a racist comment from the crowd,\" reported Sky Sports' Peter Drury at the time on commentary.\nSky Sports' Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher called the incident \"despicable,\" with Neville saying: \"It overshadows what should be an amazing night; the first day of the Premier League season, a beautiful day, and that boy has [reported being] racially abused.\n\"It's despicable. However, it has happened. It will keep on happening. It's a sorry state.\"\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes football has to continue to try to educate the next generation about racism.\n\"The only thing we can do is deal with it by dealing with him personally and try to educate the next generation,\" Van Dijk said. \"That is the only way to try and kick it out, in my opinion.\n\"I can't believe it. These things shouldn't happen but unfortunately it does and it is an absolute disgrace in my eyes.\n\"First and foremost these things should never happen in the world, not only football. But in general racism is not of this world in my opinion, but if we are to be realistic, unfortunately, it still exists and that is the painful side of it.\n\"We have to deal with it in the here and now.\"\nVan Dijk offered words of support to Semenyo, adding: \"I am here for Antoine, whenever he needs it and we are here as a club to deal with it in the best way possible because it shouldn't happen.\n\"But we stand with him completely.\"\nMerseyside Police said after the game: \"Merseyside Police will not tolerate hate crime of any form. We take incidents like this very seriously, and in cases like this we will be proactively seeking football banning orders, with the club, against those responsible.\"\nThe incident came two days after Tottenham's Mathys Tel received racist abuse online after missing a penalty in his side's Super Cup defeat against Paris Saint-Germain.\nKick It Out CEO Hollie Varney has praised Semenyo for his reaction to the situation and the way it was dealt with by the Bournemouth forward during the game at Anfield.\n\"The way Semenyo reacted was fantastic,\" Varney told Sky Sports News . \"It was incredibly inspiring. The action has to be led by football authorities and those in charge; it shouldn't be on players to address the issues.\n\"He shouldn't expect the abuse to happen simply for going to work. What we would like to see is a consistent framework in how we deal with abuse and the consequences that are carried out.",

        "title": "Thomas Frank's Tottenham are flexible, Nottingham Forest change it up and Man Utd's possession in The Debrief",
        "content": "Welcome to The Debrief , a Sky Sports column in which Adam Bate uses a blend of data and opinion to reflect on some of the key stories from the latest Premier League matches. This week:\n\nHaving been in Udine to see Tottenham come close to doing a number on Paris Saint-Germain, the question was whether or not they would be able to adjust their style of play three days later against Burnley. Thomas Frank answered that emphatically.\nThe passing of Guglielmo Vicario illustrated that most clearly in their 3-0 win on Saturday. Having directed the ball long against PSG, the Spurs goalkeeper switched the focus to ball retention against Burnley, attempting only two kicks over the halfway line.\nIn fact, Spurs as a side attempted the most passes inside their own half of any team on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. Frank pointed out afterwards that the move for Richarlison's second goal featured 17 passes - and included Vicario.\nRicharlison impressed again and with 13 goals in his last 16 starts, is emerging once more as a robust alternative to Dominic Solanke. The Brazilian registered three shots on target inside the penalty box - equalling his record for any game in his Premier League career.\nIn midfield, Frank trusted two teenagers, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall, with Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha dropping to the bench. At the back, Kevin Danso, the new long-throw specialist, made way to accommodate Brennan Johnson - who duly scored.\nIt has been a promising start for Frank, particularly given that he had to manage those midweek exertions in Italy. His flexibility was a factor in his appointment, having been a persistent source of criticism for his predecessor and he got the balance right against Burnley.\n\nSpurs not only created, scoring three against a side that did not even concede two in a single league game last season, but did so while keeping a clean sheet - their first in this competition since February and as many as in their previous 18 home games.\nIt is Manchester City away next, which will be as difficult as it gets. But Frank has already shown supporters that he is capable of setting this team up in whatever way that the match situation demands. Keep a close eye on Vicario's pass choices in that one.\n\nA build-up attack is defined as a sequence in open play that contains 10 or more passes and ends either in a shot on goal or at least a touch inside the box. The team that did that the most times on the opening Premier League weekend was Nottingham Forest.\nNuno Espirito Santo's team did it seven times in their 3-1 win over Brentford, which is unusual because the most they managed in any game last season was just five. They ranked bottom but one in the Premier League for build-up attacks during that campaign.\nOf course, it was a hugely successful season for Forest in which they came so close to securing Champions League football. But their style was built on containment without the ball and counter-attacking with it - they ranked top for the direct speed of their attacks.\nThere was still evidence of that in beating Brentford. Chris Wood's second goal came from a transition and it is clear that Forest will keep setting the traps that did for so many last year. But against Brentford there were also examples of clever pressing, of a possession game.\nForest completed 126 passes in the final third - the most of any Premier League team. After a pre-season in which Nuno complained about the lack of additions and one that featured no fewer than five goalless draws, maybe they have added some new aspects, after all.\nThat could prove important. Had Forest beaten Leicester at home - or indeed Brentford at the City Ground - towards the back end of last season, it could have been enough for a top-five finish. The manner of this performance suggests Nuno is out to address that.\n\nRoy Keane may have bemoaned the erosion of standards that have led to Manchester United's home defeat to Arsenal being viewed as a positive step but the reality is that Ruben Amorim's side exceeded most expectations with their performance on Sunday.\nIt was not just that they caused one of the title favourites such problems but it was the way that they dominated the ball that surprised. Regardless of the game state, United have not done that against one of the top teams for a long time - and the stats back that up.\nIn Premier League matches against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City - last season's top four and the favourites to contend this time around - you have to go back almost a decade to find an example of United having 60 per cent of the possession.\nAll three examples since Sir Alex Ferguson left came under Louis van Gaal in 2015. If Amorim can begin to fuse the possession game of the Dutchman with the potent running power of new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha then there is hope.\nBoth Mbeumo and Cunha had chances to mark their Premier League debuts for the club with a goal. That they did not owes something to David Raya in the Arsenal goal and that dreaded phrase 'regression to the mean' that has been muttered about both men.\nMbeumo scored 20 goals for Brentford last season from an expected-goals tally of just 12.26. In every single game in which he had better chances than this last season, he scored. Remarkably, the same statistic was also true of Cunha. Rotten luck for United.\nAnd yet, despite that disappointment, the overriding feeling is that if Amorim can keep getting the ball to his talented ball carriers in good areas then, whether it is Benjamin Sesko or Mason Mount up front with them, United will be a very different proposition this season.",

        "title": "Cristian Romero: Tottenham captain signs new long-term contract with club after summer of uncertainty over future",
        "content": "Tottenham captain Cristian Romero has signed a new long-term contract with the club to end the uncertainty over his future.\nSky Sports News understands the 27-year-old has penned a four-year deal to keep him at the club until the summer of 2029.\nThe Argentina international's fresh terms are a huge boost to Spurs, with Romero having just two years left on his previous deal, and he was of interest to Atletico Madrid this summer.\nThe defender's deal comes just five days after he was named as the club's new captain by boss Thomas Frank following the departure of Heung-Min Son to LAFC.\nUpon signing his new deal, Romero said: \"I'm very happy here in the club. For me, this club is the best in the world.\n\"The last two weeks, first becoming captain and now signing the contract with the club. For me, it's a fantastic decision\n\"My message to the fans is thank you for your amazing support every day and every match. For me, and it's important also for the team.\"\n\n\nHe added: \"Going on to the pitch with my son [on Saturday before the win over Burnley], it's special for me. First time as captain and it is incredible for me.\n\"I love football, I love this club. It's special for me going to the pitch with him.\n\"After winning the Europa League, it's like a special season now. In football, sometimes there are good moments, bad moments. The most important thing for me is to stay all together.\n\"We want to win. Maybe, why not again this season? Another trophy with the club is important for everyone.\"\n\nSky Sports News understands Romero's new contract was drawn up once he was made captain.\nSpurs acted quickly to tie Romero down to an extension, as he was into the final two years of his previous deal, while the new contract ensures the north London club protect his value.\nIt is also understood Spurs never considered Atletico's interest in Romero, and keeping the centre-back was a priority this summer.\n\nThe future of Romero is understood to have been key to discussions with Frank when he was appointed Spurs boss in June.\nFrank chose to make Romero captain when it was decided that Son was leaving, and Romero is believed to be extremely happy with the way things have gone in the first few months under the Dane.\nRomero scored in his first game as Tottenham skipper last week in the UEFA Super Cup defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, before helping Spurs to victory in their Premier League season opener on Saturday in a 3-0 home win over Burnley.\n\nThe World Cup winner has been a key player since arriving from Atalanta in the summer of 2021, having initially joined on a season-long loan before making the move permanent the following year for a fee in the region of £42m.\nRomero was a crucial part of last season's Europa League glory, which ended the Spurs' 17-year trophy drought, as he was named player of the tournament.\nHe was also given the player of the match in the 1-0 final win over Manchester United in Bilbao.\nBut there were doubts around Romero's future despite the Europa League success as he sent out a cryptic message on social media in the wake of Ange Postecoglou's dismissal in June. In the message, he praised his achievements with the line, \"despite the many obstacles that always existed and always will exist.\"\nHowever, Romero has now begun life under Frank strongly and is targeting more silverware under the ex-Brentford boss.\nSpeaking last Friday, Frank praised Romero and explained why he had chosen him as his skipper.\n\"I see a very big and very good player. What I like about him and why I have chosen him as captain is his leadership qualities on the pitch,\" the 51-year-old said.\n\"There is a big respect for him from the players. Off the pitch as well he also sets the standards.\n\"The staff have said to me they've never seen him train that well. He's in a very good place. I see a player that will want to lead the team and push the team.\"\n\n\nFull-back Djed Spence has also signed a new deal at Spurs.\nVersatile full-back Spence only signed fresh terms last October until 2028, but has been rewarded for a fine breakthrough campaign at Tottenham.\nSpence made 35 appearances in the 2024-25 campaign, after eventually being handed his full debut in December – two-and-a-half years after he first joined the club.\nAfter Spence was deemed a “club signing” by former Tottenham boss Antonio Conte in 2022, he had mixed loans at Rennes, Leeds and Genoa, but forced his way into Postecoglou’s plans and has quickly gained the trust of Frank.",

        "title": "Luis Diaz decisive for Bayern Munich in Supercup win: Harry Kane tipping new team-mate to score 15 to 20 goals",
        "content": "Luis Diaz called it “a spectacular night” as he scored what proved to be an important second goal as Bayern Munich held on to beat VfB Stuttgart 2-1 in the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup. It was the perfect illustration of why Bayern wanted him.\nThe fee that was paid to Liverpool this summer could rise to £64.7m and that might look a little chunky for a winger who will turn 29 years old in January. But when Diaz ghosted in to head home, it was a little glimpse of what the Colombian adds to this Bayern side.\nOn the face of it, Bayern had a plethora of fine options that they were able to rotate in the wide areas last season. Given that the supporters are used to seeing such quality in those positions, the bar is set high for Diaz to impress at the Bundesliga champions.\n\nBut dig a little deeper and there is hope that he can make the difference when it matters most. For example, while Kingsley Coman, now of Al Nassr, did find the net nine times last season, each of those goals came in wins that did not actually require him to score.\nThe aggregate in those matches was 36-2.\nLeroy Sane, who has left for Galatasaray, did score two goals against St Pauli in a 3-2 win but that was the only game Bayern won directly because of his goals. Diaz has already proven decisive and, as Harry Kane explains, that is what he is capable of bringing to this team.\nAsking Kane about that after the game, he said: \"I think you can see what he brings one-v-one on the wing. Really sharp, really agile. I think his biggest asset, and probably what is going to be great for us this year, is the fact he scores goals like he did today.\"\nKane added: \"He gets into that six-yard box, he makes those runs and he has got a great finish. I think it is important, especially in this modern football, for the wingers to be scoring hopefully 15 to 20 goals a season. The goal was a great run, a great finish.\"\nThe England captain continued: \"He had a couple of others that he was unlucky with in the game. For him, it will be great confidence. Scoring in your first competitive game for a new club is great and for it to be the winning goal is a perfect start for him.\"\nKane, of course, was denied that perfect start on his own Bayern debut two summers ago when he was thrust into a Supercup on home soil that ended in a shock 3-0 defeat to RB Leipzig. His transfer had only been completed in the early hours of that morning.\nReflecting on that at the end of the night in Stuttgart, Kane now describes it all as \"a bit of a whirlwind\" and \"a crazy 24 hours\" - but the fall-out lasted longer. It robbed Bayern of momentum and they ended up relinquishing the title for the first time in 11 years.\n\"It is important to have that momentum to start the year,\" he says now. It feels particularly key after a disappointing Club World Cup, during which Jamal Musiala was seriously injured and key dressing-room figure Thomas Muller said his emotional goodbyes.\nKane admits that the players are still getting used to life without the latter. \"He only really left last week. We have to look forward, we have to move on. He was a big character but that gives other people opportunities to step up and be that leader, be that person.\"\nThere is no choice. The demands at Bayern are relentless. \"We celebrate every trophy like it is the first and we move on to the next one.\" That means looking to retain the Bundesliga title before achieving their ultimate ambition of winning the Champions League.\n\"We will be one of the favourites. PSG, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Man City, Liverpool, all the big teams are going to have their eye on that trophy. But as we know, there is a long journey from now until that final. Step by step, we try to move in the right direction.\"\n\nThat pursuit of the Champions League is the chief reason why Diaz is in Bavaria. There is no denying that Bayern proved themselves capable of punishing weaker opposition under Vincent Kompany but there are still question marks against the stronger sides.\nThey were knocked out of the cup by Bayer Leverkusen and beaten by Barcelona long before Inter ousted them from the Champions League. They drew two Klassikers against Borussia Dortmund and lost both Club World Cup games against European opposition.\nThere is a suspicion that they need to up the work rate if they are to come out on top in those games, adding energy on and off the ball. It was interesting that even though Diaz was clearly still getting up to speed, this was the specific quality being cited in Stuttgart.\nBayern's sporting director Christoph Freund told reporters afterwards: \"You could see how hard-working he is. I think that is a very important point over the whole season, that he is a player who works very, very hard and can still do decisive things up front.\"\nPerhaps Bayern will still need more. Kane himself hinted at some of the challenges. \"It has been a short pre-season. We have had to get a lot of stuff done in a short space of time.\" He was even unusually candid about the requirement for more new signings.\n\"It is one of the smallest squads I have probably played in. There is still time from now until the end of the transfer window. We have a couple of really good young players who have done well in the pre-season games, but we are a little light, if we are being honest.\n\"We are going to need everyone. With the squad we have, everyone is going to play, everyone is going to get opportunities. There are going to be moments where each individual has to step up and show what they can do.\" Luis Diaz, of course, already has.",

        "title": "Scottish Premiership transfers: What does your club still need to add before deadline day?",
        "content": "The Scottish Premiership transfer window closes on September 1, but who does your club still need to add?\nIt has not been another flying start for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership, losing their first two games without scoring.\nJimmy Thelin has made nine signings so far, two on loan, with Marko Lazetic from AC Milan his latest.\n\nA striker was top of the Dons' need list. Their top scorer last season was loanee Kevin Nisbet - his departure, as well as not replacing Bojan Miovski when he left last summer, meant there was a shortage up top.\nKusini Yengi has also arrived at Pittodrie following his departure from Portsmouth, but it has been a tough start for the Australia international, who didn't score a competitive goal last season.\nThelin will be hoping Kenan Bilalovic's arrival helps fill the void left by Jamie McGrath and Leighton Clarkston's move to a deeper role, while another left-back would free up captain Graeme Shinnie for his role in midfield.\n\nBrendan Rodgers' side have made a winning start to their Premiership title defence but with a European campaign ahead, there is work to do before deadline day.\nIt is in the attacking areas that Celtic are most lacking as they aim to qualify for Europe's elite competition again.\nWinger Nicolas Kuhn left for Como earlier this month, and options have been limited after talisman Kyogo Furuhashi left in January.\nJota is expected to miss a large spell of this campaign, meaning another injury to the likes of Daizen Maeda or James Forrest would leave Hyun-Jun Yang and Marco Tilio - the latter with just two Hoops appearances before loan spells - as Rodgers' options.\n\nBenjamin Nygren can play as a wide player, but is favoured through the middle, meaning direct competition for Arne Engles.\nWhile Adam Idah is Rodgers' preferred frontman, he is yet to score this season. Callum Osmand has been brought in as one for the future, meaning Jonny Kenny and new signing Shin Yamada - both relatively untested - are his back-up options for that position.\nSteven Pressley has already said it's \"critical\" that Dundee add to their squad before the end of the transfer window but admits some targets have preferred moves to other clubs.\nThe new Dens Park boss insists his squad is far short of what is needed for the challenges ahead this season and it is essential that he increases his options.\nDundee are already out of the League Cup, but did hold Rangers to a draw at Ibrox to pick up their first point of the Scottish Premiership campaign.\nA host of players left at the end of last season, including Lyall Cameron, Joe Shaughnessy and Josh Mulligan. While nine have arrived, including Yan Dhanda from Hearts, Pressley will want more with his squad light in a number of areas.\nThe transfer window is still open, but Jim Goodwin has already had to defend his summer signing policy with no Scottish players moving to Tannadice Park.\nHe insists he tried for home-grown players, but they went elsewhere for more money and the United Academy will always be a major feeder for his team.\nThere is no doubt the club have a Sam Dalby-shaped hole to fill with the striker scoring 15 league goals while on loan from Wrexham last season. While Zac Sapsford has impressed early on in his Dundee United career, he is set to be out for four weeks with an injury suffered in Europe. So, could Goodwin move for another forward before the window shuts?\nHe has also been boosted by the return of Liverpool's Luca Stephenson. The defender was named the club's young player of the year last season, and fans will hope he can impress again during this campaign, after agreeing a loan deal at the club.\nJohn McGlynn wanted to show loyalty to the players who secured promotion for Falkirk, a decision which could prove costly this season.\nJust four players have joined the Scottish Premiership newcomers so far and the Bairns have taken just one point from their opening two games.\nDefensive errors have proved costly, so can McGlynn strengthen at the back before they come up against even tougher opposition this season?\nBrian Graham and Scott Arfield were his only viable attacking options on the bench in their defeat at Livingston last time out - that's a duo with a combined age of 73, so you would expect him to be looking for a younger option to add to the ranks as well.\n\nDerek McInnes has made a blistering league start at Hearts, boosted by the addition of nine summer signings.\nWith strikers Claudio Braga and Elton Kabangu joining, plus captain Lawrence Shankland signing a new deal in the summer - Hearts don't need more new forwards.\nHowever, could they look to strengthen at the other end, including a goalkeeper - with Craig Gordon still injured?\nWhile McInnes may have got the bulk of his incomings secured, he will still look to trim his squad in areas, with around 30 players in his first-team ranks.\nThe Jambos have been proactive with new shareholder Tony Bloom intent on using shrewd data-based recruitment to crack Celtic and Rangers' duopoly of the Scottish top flight, and eventually help Hearts to their first league title since 1960.\nAfter years of turmoil at Easter Road, Hibs now appear to be very much on the up.\nDavid Gray has the side on the verge of securing European football until Christmas and they're also through to the League Cup quarter-finals.\nProgression to the Conference League could see the head coach handed a transfer boost for some late signings to cope with the challenge of European football.\nHibs have already broken their transfer record this summer to sign Togo international striker Thibault Klidje from Luzern. Gray has told the fans to be \"patient\" with him, but he's already off the mark, scoring the opener in their League Cup win against St Johnstone.\nAs well as big money moves, Hibs have also been shrewd in their business by adding Josh Mulligan and Jamie McGrath on free, plus the experienced Grant Hanley.\nStuart Kettlewell seems to have a clear vision for Kilmarnock and there has been a huge squad overhaul since he took charge in May.\nHe did lose a lot of quality with the likes of Bobby Wales, Danny Armstrong and Corrie Ndaba leaving, but he has added 12 players, with 11 of them on permanent deals.\n\nTeenager Ben Brannan's also been a revelation while playing out of position - the defender has already netted a goal-of-the-season contender.\nCould his new freedom in midfield see Kettlewell look to further strengthen his back line before September 1?\nLivingston's transfer business looked all but done, with David Martindale strengthening his squad for their top-flight return.\nHe added 14 new players, with a mix of Scottish Premiership experience and youth, as he took advantage of the club's new ownership and the ability to add more players.\nMartindale then wanted to trim his group to around 23 players. However, it looks like he will need to make further signings.\nNew arrival Aidan Denholm faces months out with a hamstring injury, while Celtic loanee Adam Montgomery, Danny Wilson and Graham Carey have all picked up knocks.\nHe is also without the likes of Cammy Kerr for a long period, meaning midfield and defence will be areas Martindale will look to strengthen over the coming weeks.\nThey have taken four points from their opening Premiership games and, although out of the League Cup, the manager should be encouraged by what his new-look squad are offering so far.\n\nIt has been a summer of change at Motherwell with Jens Berthel Askou losing one of his top young talents just weeks after taking charge of the club.\nLennon Miller left for Udinese for a club record fee of £4.7m and the manager is well aware that not all of that will be available to him for transfers.\nNew loan signing Eseosa Soule has returned to West Brom for rehab, with the club moving quickly to add Esapa Osong on a season-long loan from Nottingham Forrest as a replacement for the injured striker.\nBerthel has nine new players in, a number needed with 10 returning to their parent clubs at the end of last season after loan spells in North Lanarkshire. It is fair to say he will expect a few more to arrive before September 1.\nNew head coach Russell Martin has brought in 10 new players, plus Oscar Cortes' deal became permanent after his loan at Ibrox last season.\nSo what else might happen over the next fortnight? Well, you'd imagine a striker and defender are most likely to still be on the summer wishlist.\nDanilo, Cyriel Dessers and Hamza Igamane have all featured to varying extents at the top end of the pitch - but all have struggled for consistency and suffered with injuries.\nIn defence, Rangers have added centre-backs Nasser Djiga and Emmanuel Fernandez, plus full-backs Jayden Meghoma and Max Aarons.\nHowever, with Jefte set to depart and the likes of Ridvan Yilmaz, Ben Davies and Leon King being allowed to leave - Martin will want more cover for his back-line.\nGers chiefs did say the Rangers squad rebuild would not be complete after just one window - but Martin will still hope for a few more faces before this one closes. If they are to qualify for the Champions League, he'd hope to have more money to spend in the closing days of the window.\nStephen Robinson had targeted six new signings this summer, a figure he has already surpassed as he aims for another top-six finish.\nA total of 12 new players have arrived in Paisley, with Killian Phillips and Roland Idowu joining on permanent deals after impressing on loan.\nKeanu Baccus has returned to his \"home away from home\" after re-joining the Buddies just over a year after leaving for Mansfield Town and Robinson believes he now has \"arguably one of the best midfields in the league\".\nIt's fair to say he would still like to add a striker to his squad before deadline day but either way, the Saints boss appears to have strengthened a side that narrowly missed out on European football.",

I feel like it's the right time for me, and it's a great opportunity to play regular football at the highest level. It feels like the perfect fit.\n\"The team play very nice football. It's fast and it really suits my game, so I felt like I couldn't say no to the chance to play here.\"\nGannon Doak is the Cherries’ fourth summer signing, taking the club's spending to just under £100m following the arrivals of goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic , left-back Adrien Truffert and centre-back Bafode Diakite .\n\nTiago Pinto, the club's Head of Football Operations, said: \"Ben is an exciting young talent who has shown his quality at the highest level despite his age.\n\"﻿He brings pace and energy that will fit our model well, and we're thoroughly looking forward to helping him fulfil his potential at AFC Bournemouth.\n\"﻿We're pleased to bring another player into the club during this window as we continue to reinvest in the squad.\"\n\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Liverpool influence at Man City? Jamie Carragher explains how former Jurgen Klopp assistant Pep Lijnders may be impacting Pep Guardiola",
        "content": "Man City's 4-0 win at Wolves showed they are up for a Premier League title chase - but the way they did it had Jamie Carragher wondering whether Pep Guardiola's fresh approach has been influenced by Liverpool.\nAfter City dropped off their usual standards last term, Guardiola brought in Pep Lijnders as assistant coach, Jurgen Klopp's former deputy at Liverpool.\nWith City playing an offside trap at Molineux and scoring on the counter-attack, Carragher believes Lijnders \"is having a big influence on Guardiola\", noting the similarities with the style Lijnders and Klopp favoured during their time together at Anfield.\nDefensively, Man City repeatedly pushed up to try to catch Wolves offside - and did just that when Marshall Munetsi headed in during the first half. That plan was even executed close to the halfway line, with City's backline stepping right up high as Wolves tried to play the ball forwards.\n\"I couldn't believe what I saw, the players were all jumping high up to try and catch the Wolves players offside,\" said Carragher told Monday Night Football.\n\"This is very Liverpool-like. It made me think how much influence is maybe the new coach having on this team.\"\nWhether it was Liverpool-inspired or not, fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville applauded the performance of Man City's defence to keep such a disciplined line.\n\"It's really good play,\" he added. \"To get a back-four unit in sync like that, it takes some doing. It's really good play from [centre-back] John Stones.\"\n\nCarragher also noted similarities between City's performance with Liverpool's threat on the break under Klopp.\nTijjani Reijnders' goal came from a swift move up the field, with Guardiola making a point of celebrating with Lijnders in the aftermath.\n\"The amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohamed] Salah, breaking forward,\" said Carragher. \"When I looked at the goal from Reijnders… not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal.\n\"Of course, Pep Guardiola's teams have scored plenty of counter-attacking goals in the past. But what really stood out for this one was the type of goal it was. They win it and then they're off.\n\"Lijnders - Guardiola gives him the thanks, the hug. Now we don't know exactly what that's for, but I don't think it's a coincidence with some of the things that I saw in the game that he, as a coach, is having a big influence on Pep Guardiola.\"\nAfterwards, Guardiola himself said City were trying to be better with attacking breaks than they were last season.\n\"It's a weapon that we want to use this season - when we're getting the ball, attack quicker than maybe before.\"\nWhether it is a Liverpool inspiration from Lijnders or not, it seems clear Guardiola has once again reimagined his Man City side.\nCarragher says the serial winner recognised the shift in style in the Premier League away from controlled, patient build-up into a more dynamic approach - and has responded.\n\"What Pep said last season, when he was talking about where the game was going, he was actually saying, 'it's not really my football', the football that was seen of teams in the Premier League. Transition, end-to-end football.\n\n\"I think he mentioned Brentford, he was talking about Bournemouth, he wasn't just talking about the real top teams. How many teams in the Premier League were playing like that.\"\nCity have shown they can have success playing that way too. After learning from their rivals, they look like they will be serious contenders for the Premier League crown once again. That's a view shared by Neville.\n\"Watching that game on Saturday, it was a little bit, 'Oh, did we just forget about the obvious?' Pep Guardiola, if he loses a title, he'll win it back,\" said Neville.\n\"He wins titles nearly every single year he's coached in his career, and when you saw Reijnders on Saturday, you think of Rodri to come back in, you think of Stones and [Ruben] Dias, [Erling] Haaland up front... that's a spine and a half, that's a title-winning spine, it's a treble-winning spine with a manager who's prolific.\n\"City, just off what we've seen on Saturday, if they keep their players fit, they could be really in business.\"",

        "title": "Morecambe latest news: Ashvir Singh Johal named new Shrimps manager",
        "content": "Ashvir Singh Johal has been named the new manager of Morecambe, becoming the first Sikh to take charge of a professional British club.\nThe 30-year-old replaced Derek Adams, who was sacked on Monday, just a day after new owners Punjab Warriors completed the takeover which saved the club from extinction.\nSky Sports News understands new Morecambe owners Panjab Warriors had intended to appoint him in the summer but were delayed by the protracted sale of the club from Jason Whittingham's Bond Group.\nA Morecambe statement said: \"Ashvir Singh Johal arrives at the Mazuma Mobile Stadium with an excellent reputation as a forward-thinking coach and leader, bringing with him a wealth of experience in player development, tactical innovation, and building high-performance cultures.\n\"His appointment marks an exciting new era for the Shrimps as the club continues its journey under fresh ownership and renewed ambition.\"\nSingh Johal worked closely with Kolo Toure when the pair were coaching under Brendan Rodgers at Leicester City. He went on to join the former Ivory Coast international at Wigan as first-team coach when Toure was appointed as the club's manager almost three years ago.\nSky Sports News exclusively revealed that the move to Wigan had made Singh Johal the first Sikh to take up a frontline coaching role in Sky Bet Championship history.\nSingh Johal, who holds a UEFA Pro Licence, later had a spell as assistant coach to Cesc Fabregas at Como's academy in Italy and he now has a hefty in-tray at Morecambe, starting with building a squad as he currently only has five players under contract.\nMorecambe, who were relegated from Sky Bet League Two last season, have had their first two National League games postponed after being suspended for failing to comply with the league's rules.\nSingh Johal is due to be in the dugout as Morecambe are scheduled to open their campaign against Altrincham, though that game could also be in doubt given the club's current lack of players.\nDespite the uncertainty of the immediate future, the new boss is looking to the long term.\n\"The immediate priority right now is going to be to identify the players that we need in this building to ensure Morecambe Football Club can perform well in the National League,\" he said in an interview with the club's official website.\n\"I think the short-term plan this year is to make sure that we retain our place in the National League by playing exciting, energetic football and working hard. I think that is a short-term aim.\n\"The long-term aim is to build the processes, the infrastructure. There's a clear commitment from the owners about the direction they want the club to go in.\n\"OK, now it's about building, and it's about growing and making sure that in three, four, five years' time, this is a completely energised and galvanised more football club that thrives in the EFL.\"\nAt 30, Singh Johal, who never played professional football and worked his way up the coaching ranks with a 10-year stint at Leicester, is one of the youngest coaches to earn the UEFA Pro Licence. He left Notts County in the summer where he was their B Team head coach.\nOn becoming a first-team manager for the first time, he added: \"It's what I've wanted to do. It's been my dream since I was 14 or 15 years old.\n\"It's every single day that's been the target I've worked towards. But for me, now there's a new target, and the target is to make sure Morecambe is successful as a club.\n\"Make sure this year we don't just survive in the National League, we thrive.\"\nAnti-discrimination charity Kick It Out applauded Singh Johal's appointment.\nIt said in a post on X: \"History made. Congratulations to Ashvir Singh Johal on becoming the first Sikh manager in professional football.\n\"Fully deserved and also a significant milestone for representation in leadership within the game.\"",

        "title": "Paul Merson says: Advantage Arsenal after 'vital' win but Man City's performance a warning",
        "content": "Paul Merson gives his verdict on the opening weekend of the season, including a \"vital\" win for Arsenal at Man Utd and Man City's \"impressive\" rout of Wolves.\nIn his exclusive column for skysports.com , the Magic Man also gives his thoughts on United's goalkeeper issues, Tottenham's start under Thomas Frank and Chelsea's lack of cutting edge in front of goal...\n\nThe name of the game is winning.\nOld Trafford is a difficult place to go, especially on the opening weekend, but Arsenal found a way to win.\nThey will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.\nIt was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.\n\nBut advantage Arsenal. The way I see it now is Liverpool and Man City have to go to Old Trafford to win to match Arsenal, and that's a huge positive at such an early stage of the season.\nSpecial mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.\nThere were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.\nIf he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.\n\nNo-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.\nIt's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.\nThe win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.\nI know it wasn't the hardest game in Wolves, but winning away from home 4-0 on the opening day of the Premier League is no mean feat.\nIt was the result of the weekend for me because no-one on Soccer Saturday mentioned them as title winners. Everyone is on Liverpool or Arsenal but the performance from City was a wake-up call for everyone.\nThere will be bigger tests to come for them, that's for sure, starting on Saturday against Spurs, but they were very impressive.\nIt is rare in football that a club wins a league title, a Champions League, a Euros or a World Cup without a solid goalkeeper.\nYou have to have a good goalkeeper because they save you points. David Raya won Arsenal points on Sunday, Alisson Becker does it continually for Liverpool and Ederson has done it through the years at Man City.\nAltay Bayindir has lost Man Utd points already with that error against Arsenal. It was a big mistake, a critical mistake in the end.\n\nI can't emphasise how important a top goalkeeper is to a football club and Man Utd have to now react before the transfer window closes.\nApart from that error, Man Utd did alright against Arsenal.\nI was impressed with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo but there is still plenty they need to work on to improve as a cohesive unit.\nAdd in a fit and firing Benjamin Sesko and they will definitely cause plenty of teams problems, but there is still plenty to solve for Ruben Amorim.\nThey played as well as they could against Arsenal but still lost the game. That's not the best sign for a team.\nI still can't see them not being around the middle of the table come the end of the season without further improvement before the transfer window closes.\n\nChelsea were not good against Crystal Palace. The draw was worrying.\nIf Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea.\nPalmer is now the talk of the town in team talks up against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea. Stop Cole Palmer will be the message for West Ham on Friday. That's just how it is.\nHe needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.\nBut he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.\nIt's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.\nIt's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.\nYou cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.\n\nI'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.\nThat was a must-win game against Burnley. I expected it to be a bit tighter so credit to Spurs for that, but it would have been a shock had they not got all three points at the weekend.\nIt was a good result, but the acid test is still to come. Let's see how they perform at Man City at the weekend and then we can start to make a judgement.\nPeople were going mad about the PSG performance but there's still a long way to go for Spurs.\n\nIt wasn't hard for Thomas Frank to change things up considering what came before. Ange Postecoglou's Spurs were so open, as open as you can ever seem from a football manager and team, so it wasn't going to take much to adjust.\nYou don't need to be Albert Einstein to work out how to play against PSG. You need as many defenders as you can on the pitch. Then, against Burnley, you need as many attackers on the pitch as you can to keep causing them problems.\nA lot of Tottenham fans have been on already saying this is it, but the acid test is against Man City this weekend and he can set up to stop Pep Guardiola's side playing.",

        "title": "Michelle Agyemang: Lionesses forward rejoins Brighton on loan from Arsenal",
        "content": "Michelle Agyemang is returning to Brighton on loan from Arsenal.\nAgyemang - who was a star for England at Euro 2025 - enjoyed a successful first spell at Brighton last season, scoring five goals in 22 appearances. But Arsenal have fierce competition for forward spots this season with the likes of Alessia Russo, Beth Mead, Caitlin Foord and Stina Blackstenuis, in their playing ranks - as well as new £1m summer signing Olivia Smith from Liverpool.\nSo Agyemang will spend the next campaign on the south coast for consistent minutes and playing time.\nAgyemang played a key role in England's triumph at the Women's Euros. The 19 year old scored twice in four appearances, including crucial late equalisers in the quarter-final and semi-final, and was subsequently named Young Player of the Tournament.\nArsenal's director of women's football Clare Wheatley praised Agyemang's progress and explained the reasoning behind the move: \"We're so proud of Michelle's achievements this summer and throughout her journey at Arsenal, from her first steps in our academy through to our first-team squad.\n\"After discussing closely with Michelle and her family, we have all agreed that this move will provide Michelle with a further opportunity to develop and grow, as she continues to progress as a young player and person.\n\"We wish Michelle every success at Brighton and look forward to welcoming her back to Arsenal at the end of her loan.\"\nAgyemang will now look to build on her breakout year as she begins her second spell with Brighton, with the Seagulls kicking off their WSL campaign against Aston Villa on September 7th, live on Sky Sports.\nSky Sports News' Anton Toloui:\nIt may seem surprising that one of the stars of the Euros is going out on loan but Arsenal are playing the long game.\nIf Michelle Agyemang had stayed at Arsenal she'd be behind Alessia Russo and Stina Blackstenuis and so keeping her to sit on the bench would offer short-term insurance but at the cost her of development.\nThat development has been beyond rapid. She'd only started one WSL match before scoring on her England debut in April and a summer of training and playing with the best in the country proved she's England's present as well as future.\nNow Agyemang goes back to a club and coach that know her well, where she'll be the starting No.9 and where she already has a connection with the fan base.\nThe only way this comes back to haunt Arsenal if their incumbent strikers suffer injury or a lack of form. They're sticking to the plan that Agyemang will take over from Blackstenius next season.\nFor the ever-ambitious Brighton, they've got one of the continent's top young players to help boost their WSL ambitions.\nSky Sports will be embarking on a new five-year partnership with the WSL, showing 90 per cent of all Women's Super League matches from the 2025/26 season.\nReigning champions Chelsea will be aiming to secure a record-extending seventh straight WSL title - but they will likely face a major challenge from European champions Arsenal , who have made a summer statement by signing Liverpool's Smith as the first £1m player in women's football.\nThe two Manchester sides City and United will be hoping to compete as well, with City, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur among the clubs beginning new eras with new managers.",

But there's been so many names floated about. I wouldn't disclose either way.\"\n\nThe transfer window closes on September 1, with Hoops fans frustrated by the lack of new signings while some players could also still leave Parkhead.\n\"There's so much noise, especially as it ramps up towards the end,\" the Northern Irishman added.\n\"I've been in enough changing rooms to know how stability can be lost in this moment, because some players will be thinking, are they staying, are they going?\n\"But in the midst of that, you've got really important games.\n\"I've already mentioned this to players a number of weeks back, and respecting and acknowledging that it is a difficult part of the season.\n\"However, the money will be in your bank every month and it'll be from Celtic, whilst you need to perform so you don't need to worry about anything else.\n\"I respect and acknowledge that it can be tough, especially, are you going to be here or are you not?\n\"But Celtic pay your wages, and while they do, you focus on doing the very best you can for Celtic.\"\nCeltic captain Callum McGregor believes the club should only add new signings that will improve the squad.\n\"Everyone is impatient in football,\" he said.\n\"Everybody wants the next new shiny thing and that's just where we are.

The team are in good momentum, got some good results last year in the Champions League.\n\"We've started well so we have to trust the team that's there to go and do the job as well and of course like everyone we want quality players to come in and add to that and help.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports",

        "title": "Alexander Isak transfer news: Liverpool target breaks silence to declare he 'can't continue' at Newcastle",
        "content": "Liverpool target Alexander Isak says his relationship with Newcastle \"can't continue\" and \"change is in the best interests of everyone\" as he accused the club of broken promises over his future.\nHours after the striker delivered his bombshell statement, Newcastle responded by refuting Isak's suggestion he was told he could leave this summer and insisted they \"do not foresee\" the player being sold, as their terms are unlikely to be met.\nIsak's potential sale has always been dependent on Newcastle signing an adequate replacement and a club meeting their £150m valuation. With less than two weeks left in the window, neither of those conditions have been met.\nIsak, 25, is currently training away from his team-mates, and arrived at the Newcastle United training ground just after 3pm on Wednesday, the day after he posted the statement on social media.\nNewcastle added in their reply: \"Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his team-mates.\"\nIsak's explosive statement said: \"I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors.\n\n\"The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading.\n\"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue. That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.\"\nNewcastle's statement in response read: \"We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views.\n\"As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take into consideration the best interests of Newcastle United, the team and our supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a sale this summer have not transpired.\n\"We do not foresee those conditions being met.\n\"This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive to retain our family feel. Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his teammates.\"\nSky Sports News reported in July that Isak had informed Newcastle he wanted to explore his options this transfer window.\nAt the start of August, Liverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid rejected by Newcastle for the 25-year-old.\nIsak took his frustrations public on Tuesday with an update on Instagram posted during the PFA awards ceremony, which he skipped despite being nominated for the top prize of Player of the Year, due to his current stand-off with Newcastle.\nHe said: \"I'm proud to be recognised by my fellow professionals with a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Season for 2024/25.\n\"First and foremost I want to thank my teammates and everyone at Newcastle United who has supported me along the way.\n\"I'm not at the ceremony tonight. With everything going on, it didn't feel right to be there.\"\nNewcastle have so far failed to bring in a striker to cover the loss of Callum Wilson let alone Isak.\nThey have been unsuccessful this summer with attempts to sign Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko - both of whom were considered potential successors to Isak - and have very limited options with less than two weeks left of the window.\nNewcastle had a £25m bid rejected for Yoane Wissa earlier in the window, but made a new bid worth £35m plus add-ons on Wednesday.\nWissa is viewed by Newcastle as a second-choice striker and his potential arrival would likely not help Isak get his move.\nOther than Isak, Newcastle currently only have one recognised striker on their books in 22-year-old William Osula, who did not start a single Premier League game for the club last season.\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\n\"Newcastle are stressing here that they have been unable to find a suitable replacement for Alexander Isak, coupled by Liverpool's opening bid falling significantly below the striker's valuation.\n\"Had Newcastle managed to sign Hugo Ekitike or Benjamin Sesko, who joined Liverpool and Manchester United respectively, then in all likelihood the club would have reluctantly sold Isak to Liverpool with an increased bid from the Premier League champions.\n\"Newcastle have tried hard to facilitate and give Isak his wish, but they cannot leave themselves without a recognised striker.\n\"Unless something out of the blue comes up between now and the window closing on September 1, it appears Isak will be staying. If and when he plays again is another story…\"\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:\n\"Newcastle talked last night about the conditions of a sale.\n\"There were two conditions.\n\"One, the valuation of the player is £150m.\n\"That is what Newcastle's valuation is. I still think they would probably do a deal for a little bit less than that. But I think Liverpool's £110m offer that landed a few weeks ago is way short. So if Liverpool were to really seriously want Isak, they would have to come to the table with a higher bid.\n\"The second is that Newcastle need to find a replacement. They tried on Benjamin Sesko, they tried on Hugo Ekitike, failed on both of those.\n\"They're actually even struggling right now, as we can see, to bring in a replacement for Callum Wilson, who left on a free contract. We've been telling you for weeks now that they've been trying to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford. But he's seen as the Callum Wilson replacement rather than the Alexander Isak replacement.\n\"So they can't even get the second striker in, if you like.\n\"If they were able to land Wissa in the next few days - and I am expecting a bid in the next couple of days - and Liverpool came to the table offering £130m then Newcastle might have a decision to make.\n\"However, it would leave them very light on striker reinforcements.\"\n\nJuly 15: Liverpool told Isak not for sale in this window after making informal approach to Newcastle - and decide to rival them for Hugo Ekitike instead after being rebuffed.\nJuly 19: Eddie Howe reveals after pre-season friendly defeat at Celtic that Isak travelled with the rest of the squad to Glasgow but he chose to send him home \"due to the speculation around him\".\nJuly 23: Liverpool beat Newcastle to the signing of Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt after the North East club had already missed out on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro.\nJuly 24: Isak is not included in Newcastle's squad for pre-season tour of Asia due to what Newcastle described as a \"minor thigh injury\".\nJuly 24: It later emerges that Isak has informed Newcastle he wants to explore his options in this transfer window.\nJuly 31: Sky Sports News reports that Isak is training individually at former club Real Sociedad's facilities.\nAugust 1: Newcastle reject an official bid from Liverpool for Isak worth £110m plus add-ons.\nAugust 2: Newcastle make formal bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko worth nearly £70m and Isak later flies back to the North East after his personal training camp in Spain.\nAugust 4: The striker returns to Newcastle's training ground for the first time and has trained separately from his team-mates ever since.\nAugust 4: Newcastle up their offer to RB Leipzig for Sesko amid interest from Manchester United.\nAugust 8: Newcastle boss Eddie Howe says \"we would love the player to be with us\" about Isak after he misses friendly win over Espanyol at St James' Park.\nAugust 9: Manchester United beat Newcastle to the signing of Sesko despite their offer to RB Leipzig being lower.\nAugust 16: Isak not included in Newcastle squad for Premier League season opener against Aston Villa - but Howe says \"door is well and truly open\" for a return.\nAugust 19: Isak skips PFA awards and releases a statement on Instagram accusing Newcastle of broken promises, telling the club \"change is in the best interests of everyone\".\nAugust 19: Newcastle release a statement in response to Isak, denying that promises were made to allow Isak to leave and insisting they would welcome him back when he is \"ready to rejoin his team-mates\"\n\nSky Sports' Jamie Carragher speaking last week:\n\"I don't like the way he's going about it, and I don't think any football fan should.\n\"There is nothing wrong with wanting to leave a club, that's the nature of the game, players leave clubs every summer, but you work as hard as you can and play the games. You can say you want to leave, I understand the player's frustration and a bit of bitterness because of the money on offer, but I don't think you can get to the stage where you don't train.\n\"I'm not that fussed on Liverpool signing him. He's better than (Hugo) Ekitike right now. But it almost feels like what PSG or Real Madrid tried to do a few years ago, whereby they try to sign all the best players available. Liverpool don't do that. There are other areas Liverpool should use that money.\"\nSky Sports' Gary Neville speaking last week:\n\"Isak should be angry with his agent. It's unsavoury.\n\n\"I feel sorry for Eddie Howe. Isak wants to win trophies and is agitating for a move because he's got one career. I can see both sides. He's got five or six good years left.\n\"It looks like this guy is downing tools and saying he's not playing, and I don't think that is right.\n\"Newcastle have to stand strong here. If you're the club, it sends the wrong message to sell after what has happened.\n\"I think they have to keep him for another year because the precedent will be dangerous for Newcastle.\"",

        "title": "Johan Bakayoko interview: Jurgen Klopp persuaded me to join RB Leipzig after being linked to every club in the world",
        "content": "The catalyst for Johan Bakayoko's summer move to Leipzig was a conversation with Red Bull's head of global sport. \"When I had the talk with Jurgen Klopp, that was like the trigger point for me,\" he explains. \"Before, I wanted to go. But now, I have to go.\"\nBakayoko smiles when asked what exactly Klopp said to persuade him to leave PSV in Eindhoven and make the move to RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga. \"That was the most funny part of it,\" he says. \"We did not even talk about him wanting me to come.\"\nHe explains: \"It was really about football and what vision I have on football. He even told me, like, even if you go to some other club, then you have to do this to adapt better.\" The player appreciated not being given the hard sell, just being seen as a human being.\n\"I was thinking, if someone like this talks to you in these kind of ways and he wants to build a project and he wants you to be part of it, but he doesn't want to push you to be part of it, it gives you the freedom to express yourself. And that is everything I need.\"\nKlopp has long had that personal touch. It convinced Bakayoko. \"I do not want to feel like I am pressured in some way,\" he adds. \"I just want to feel like someone wants me to help his club.\"\nAnd Bakayoko is a player who can help. He has speed and skill, he scores goals and he entertains. Klopp will have seen his performance for PSV in their 3-2 win over Liverpool in the Champions League in January, a game in which Bakayoko scored the opening goal.\nPSV head coach Peter Bosz actually criticised his players for their showboating late in that game, suggesting it was disrespectful. Bakayoko was perhaps the chief culprit. But it is just how he sees the game. He is there to make a difference - and also have fun.\nSpeaking to him about that, he says: \"I think that is just a part of me. You expect me to do these kind of things. That is just the way I am. That is not even something I am thinking about doing. That is just something that happens naturally at this point.\n\"That is not something I am forcing [myself] to do, just because someone told me to do it, I am going to do it. For me, that is how I see football and the way I want to express myself on the pitch.\" A showman, then, but one who was mightily effective for PSV.\nDo not be fooled by his total of one assist in their Eredivisie title win last season. That owed much to the misses of others. Bakayoko ranked among the top 20 for chances created per 90 minutes and also scored nine goals of his own in the competition.\nLook at the scatter graph showing players who score goals and create chances for others and it highlights the fact that he was among the most decisive players in the Eredivisie. The next, plotting goals and dribbles, shows why he was so entertaining.\nBosz had to persuade Bakayoko to stay and be part of that title success. \"In my eyes, last season was also a great opportunity to leave. But if the club do not want me to leave, that is actually not the perfect time.\" There were \"a lot of talks\" between the pair.\n\"He wanted me to make the step at the right moment and, for him, last season was not the right moment. I thought it was. But if you have a good relationship with someone, you also do not want to disappoint them because he helped me a lot when he came.\"\nThe respect for Bosz is clear. \"He gave me the opportunity, he made me a better player.\" Bakayoko decided to do one more year. \"I took his advice really seriously and he said to me, 'It's not the right time, we still have a championship to win', So I stuck to the plan.\"\nThat plan has taken him to Leipzig despite interest from elsewhere. \"For the last three years, I think I was linked to every single club in the world, maybe.\" A Premier League move was mooted but Bakayoko wanted to find \"the right project\" and believes that he has.\nHe describes his main motivation as \"just to get better\" which might explain why he turned down a lucrative switch to Saudi Arabia. At 22 years old, there is certainly time for him to add much more to his game and he clearly has the mentality to make it happen.\nHe takes visualisation seriously, using the technique to help him prepare. \"It can be everything from my decision-making to the shooting, to the passing, to go one-v-one or give a pass. It can be everything and I try to visualise and to perfect it,\" he explains.\n\"What can happen in the game for me, for my position? What could I have done better in the last games? I also start to see new solutions in my game, what I can improve, where I am lacking some things, where I am already good and where I can be better.\"\nBakayoko favours the right flank but ever since his early days in Belgium, he has been flexible. \"I played as the 10 and I played also on the left side and it was quite good so I think I am capable of doing it.\" The hope is that Leipzig coach Ole Werner can help him develop.\nAt just 37, Werner is a new breed of coach. Bakayoko describes him as \"someone with a completely new aspect of the game\" - a breath of fresh air. \"He is like a young player coming into a new team. He has the same mentality, the same hunger.\" An ideal fit for Leipzig.\nLeipzig are not in Europe this season for the first time since they won promotion to the Bundesliga almost a decade ago, but perhaps that offers the chance for a fresh start for the club, the opportunity to build a new team - with players like Bakayoko at its heart.\n\"The base is really there. You see the quality is really there. The hunger to achieve things is really there. The qualities of the coaches is really there. The staff is really there.\" He adds: \"The project for me was actually perfect. A club that really wanted me to grow.\"\nA club that really wanted him, full stop. On Friday, he makes his Bundesliga debut at Bayern Munich. \"I feel excited. I am used to big games, but this is a completely different environment.\" An environment that he just had to be part of because of Jurgen Klopp.",

        "content": "Kai Havertz is currently being assessed over a knee injury\nThe German was absent from Arsenal's open training session put on for the fans at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.\nHavertz has only just returned from a long-term hamstring injury which kept him out between February and May.\nThe club are assessing the situation and are waiting for the injury to settle before further analysis.\nJust days ago, the topic of debate was which striker out of Havertz or Viktor Gyokeres should start in Arsenal's big game against Liverpool next week. \"I think Mikel Arteta will go back to Havertz in the big games,\" said Jamie Carragher. \"I would be very surprised if Havertz doesn't play.\"\nNow it seems that the decision has been taken out of Arteta's hands.\nNo matter the severity of this Havertz knee injury, the German will be a major doubt for the trip to Anfield - placing a huge focus on Gyokeres in the first big game of his Arsenal career.\nBut once again, Arsenal are talking about injuries after it derailed them last season. Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka all missed over a dozen league matches due to injury last term - only the latter is fully fit at the start of this one.\nArsenal do know that Mikel Merino can fill in as an emergency option but that was an awkward scenario last season which Arteta and the Arsenal team made the most of. Playing the Spaniard as a No 9 again is a situation they want to avoid, if possible.\nWhat this situation does tell us, though, is that Arsenal will have to get Gyokeres on song soon, after a slightly underwhelming Premier League debut at Manchester United last weekend.\n\nSaturday's game against Leeds - which Gyokeres will almost certainly start now - is important in the early context of Arsenal's season.

        "title": "Real Madrid have world's most valuable squad but where do Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal rank?",
        "content": "Which clubs have the most valuable squads in the world?\nBetween the Lines returns with a breakdown of the top eight, according to Transfermarkt valuations , including analysis and insight into the how and why.\nSo, can anyone match the superstars of Real Madrid in terms of value? And do Arsenal really have the highest-value squad among Premier League clubs? Read on to find out.\nDespite a club-record low 15th-placed Premier League finish last season, Manchester United have the eighth-most valuable squad in the world at £766m, according to Transfermarkt .\nHaving added Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko to their attack this summer, almost half of that figure comes from their forward players, who are valued at a combined £352m.\nThe new signings offered glimpses of how they could transform Ruben Amorim's attack in Sunday's narrow defeat to Arsenal but there is still a need for more quality elsewhere in the squad.\nSky Sports pundit Gary Neville said they \"unequivocally\" need to sign a new goalkeeper. Their current options, Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton, are valued at only £29m.\nTheir midfielders, meanwhile, have less than half the value of their forwards, at £158m, further emphasising the need to bring other parts of their squad up to the level of their front line.\nLiverpool were outstanding in winning the Premier League title last season under Arne Slot but they have to settle for seventh place in the most valuable squads list.\nFlorian Wirtz has added a huge chunk of value following his arrival from Bayer Leverkusen for a British record £116.5m. Transfermarkt value the 22-year-old slightly higher than that, at £121m. But many of Liverpool's existing key players are declining in value due to age.\nMohamed Salah was valued at a high of £130.8m earlier in his Liverpool career but at 33, despite producing his best season yet last term and signing a new contract, his value is down at £43m.\nLike Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alisson Becker and Andrew Robertson, aged 34, 32 and 31 respectively, have also declined in value as Liverpool continue their work to refresh their squad, and increase its value, through recruitment this summer and beyond.\nLALIGA champions Barcelona come in at sixth, thanks in large part to their 18-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal, who ranks as the highest-value player in the world at £173m, meaning he accounts for 18 per cent of the squad's total value of £976m.\n\nBarcelona have another high-value asset in Pedri, who, like Yamal, is a product of their La Masia youth academy. The 22-year-old midfielder is valued at the same level as Liverpool's Wirtz at £121m.\nChelsea are the first of five clubs with a squad value of over £1bn.\nTheir high valuation is largely down to huge transfer spending by the club's owners, who have increased the value of their squad by signing young, high-potential signings. And a lot of them.\nSince the summer of 2022, Chelsea have spent nearly twice as much as any other Premier League club on transfers, their total of £1.52bn dwarfing the next-highest total of £861m, by Manchester United.\nThe total spent is far higher than the value of their current squad but it is worth noting Chelsea have made by far the most of any Premier League club in sales in the timeframe, allowing them to balance the books as they continue to reshape their squad in the interests of increasing its value, quality and potential.\nIt is only a year since Paris Saint-Germain lost their prized asset Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid but the club have gone from strength to strength, winning the Champions League last season and developing an extremely high-value squad under Luis Enrique.\nOusmane Dembele is now their main man but his Transfermarkt valuation of £77.7m is matched by two of his team-mates in Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who has thrived since joining from Napoli, and Desire Doue, who has emerged as one of the best young players in Europe.\nManchester City are rebuilding again under Pep Guardiola but their squad remains one of the most valuable in Europe at £1.12bn.\nThere is excitement about new recruits Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki after their goalscoring debuts in Saturday's 4-0 win over Wolves but the most valuable player in their squad, according to Transfermarkt , is unsurprisingly Erling Haaland.\nThe striker, who signed a new 10-year contract at the Etihad Stadium in January and has scored 126 goals in 147 games for the club, is valued at £155m by Transfermarkt , making him one of the most valuable players in the world.\nIt also makes him roughly £60m more valuable than any other Manchester City player, although Pep Guardiola's squad does contain numerous other high-value players, including six others valued at over £50m.\n\nIt is 21 years since Arsenal's last title win but their progress under Mikel Arteta is reflected by a soaring squad value which puts them second in the world and top among Premier League clubs.\nArsenal's squad has roughly doubled in value since Arteta's appointment in 2019, rising from around £540m to an all-time high of £1.14bn, thanks to an overhaul in personnel and an emphasis on youth typified by the talismanic Bukayo Saka, whose value has risen from £6m to £129.5m in the last six years.\nArsenal's squad planning has left them with a group of players who are mostly either in or approaching their peak years. Leandro Trossard and Christian Norgaard are their only outfielders over 30.\nTheir academy has played a huge role in building the value of their squad, first with Saka and now with Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly, who are valued at roughly £48m and £39m respectively at only 18 years old, with optimism that the 15-year-old Max Dowman could be next to follow Saka's footsteps.\nThe emergence of Saka, Nwaneri and Lewis-Skelly, all of whom cost the club nothing in transfer fees, has helped give Arsenal a Transfermarkt squad value £316m higher than its £826m cost.\nNo other Premier League club even comes close in terms of building value relative to squad cost, with Manchester United and Chelsea at the opposite end of the scale, their squad costs considerably higher than their current valuations, leaving them with negative differences.\nReal Madrid finished a disappointing season without silverware last term as Carlo Ancelotti made way for Xabi Alonso in the dugout, but it is no surprise to see them top for squad value at £1.21bn.\nTheir Galactico-filled squad features three of the five most valuable players in the world, with Jude Bellingham and Mbappe each valued at £155m - behind only Barcelona's Yamal (£173m) - while Vinicius Junior (£147m) is not far behind them and Haaland (also £155m).\nThey continue to target big names, with Trent Alexander-Arnold the latest superstar arrival, valued at £64.6m by Transfermarkt, while also signing leading young players such as Dean Huijsen, whose valuation of £51.7m is likely to grow at only 20, ensuring the squad is well placed to retain its value in the years ahead.\nBetween the Lines , a weekly Sky Sports strand revealing the data behind football's biggest stories, launched last week with a look at how the Opta and Sky Sports supercomputers' predicted Premier League tables compared. Surprises included!\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Newcastle's latest bid for Yoane Wissa has been rejected by Brentford.\nThe Magpies made the bid earlier on Wednesday, but it has now been turned down by their Premier League rivals.\nThe add-ons were understood to be worth up to a further £5m which could take the total to £40m. Newcastle had a £25m bid rejected by the Bees for Wissa earlier this summer.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Tottenham Hotspur were considering offering Richarlison in a deal for Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze. That would, in turn, have freed up striker space to try and sign Wissa, who played under Thomas Frank at Brentford.\nWissa still wants to join Newcastle.\nWissa was absent for Brentford's opening weekend fixture - a 3-1 defeat to Nottingham Forest - with Keith Andrews confirming his absence was linked to the speculation around the forward's future.\nThe west Londoners have already lost Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United for £71m, captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal and head coach Frank.\nThe 28-year-old was, however, seen in Brentford training on Tuesday. The Bees' next fixture is a home game against Aston Villa on Saturday at 3pm.\nThe pursuit of Wissa comes after more uncertainty regarding Alexander Isak 's future.\nThe Newcastle forward put out an explosive statement on Tuesday night regarding his transfer stand-off - saying his future with the Magpies \"cannot continue\" over \"broken promises\" made by the club.\n\nThis is after Liverpool saw a £110m bid rejected by Newcastle earlier this summer.\nIsak has not yet featured for Eddie Howe's side in matches since Newcastle returned to pre-season duty.

        "title": "Nick Woltemade to Bayern Munich: VfB Stuttgart’s unconventional striker has captured the imagination in Germany",
        "content": "The most talked about player in Germany right now is not Bayern Munich’s new signing Luis Diaz nor is it perennial top scorer Harry Kane. Both netted as Bayern won the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup but all eyes were on the striker still wearing a Stuttgart shirt.\nNick Woltemade is a target for Bayern after a fine first season at Stuttgart during which he scored 17 goals before going on to become the top scorer at the European Under-21 Championship in the summer. He made his senior debut for Germany just before that.\nSuch things do not go unnoticed at Bayern, as their former striker Claudio Pizarro explains. \"When a German player is doing well, then Bayern is like, 'Okay, the spotlight is out.'\" Woltemade was in that spotlight before, during and after Saturday's showpiece opener.\nDespite being denied a goal from close range by Manuel Neuer, he impressed. Dayot Upamecano, the physical Bayern centre-back, marked him closely but Woltemade showed that he was up for the fight, holding the ball up well for Stuttgart throughout.\n\"I have a feeling that Nick is very strong in times like this,\" says Atakan Karazor, his Stuttgart captain. But it is difficult to overstate the pressure on Woltemade in Germany right now. Stuttgart are holding firm but his agent keeps talking. And Bayern keep pushing.\nSpeaking to Jurgen Klinsmann, the former Germany international who made his name at Stuttgart before eventually going on to play for Bayern, there is nothing but empathy. \"It is a very logical sequence of thoughts that happens to you,\" Klinsmann explains.\n\"When a big team like Bayern Munich knocks at your door, there is a simple question that you have to ask yourself. Woltemade is probably sitting in his home or talking to his family or whoever he talks to. 'What if I don't do that? What happens if I don't do that?'\n\"I think the answer is already there. I think in every profession you want to do the best you can do. It is just in your human nature because you want to drive to play for the biggest possible team out there. It is very difficult for Stuttgart to [fight] against that.\"\nWhat is all the fuss about? Well, there are not many forwards who stand at 6'6\" tall and have the sort of ability that Woltemade possesses. The good-feet-for-a-big-man cliché might have been invented for him. Cacau, the legendary Stuttgart striker, sums it up.\n\"He is an amazing player,\" Cacau tells Sky Sports . \"He can score goals but he can also give assists. And he is a perfect player for Stuttgart, the perfect number nine. He plays very unconventionally because he is tall but he is also technical. Very, very good.\"\nRather oddly given his vast frame, Woltemade completed 31 dribbles in the Bundesliga last season. He is much more than a mere target man even if he obviously has the potential to fulfil that function. He can also roam wide, drop deep, bring others into play.\n\"Everybody can see also his dribbling and his technique,\" says Karazor. A modern twist on the big striker, then. And yet, it is this sense that he is a throwback to forwards of yesteryear that helps to explain his allure in Germany, a country still craving such players.\n\"You see the history of the German strikers, they are always tough, big guys, scoring a lot of goals,\" says Pizarro. \"And in the last years, you did not see that much. So I think it is going to be something special to get a player like that again in the Germany team.\"\nKlinsmann agrees. \"These number nines, on a global level, they are very, very rare. Very few countries have them. We love number nines in Germany so having this kid Woltemade coming up is a big hope because it is still a very important position to fill.\"\n\nThere remains a lot for him to learn. He only signed for Stuttgart last summer - and that on the back of a season in which he scored twice in 30 Bundesliga appearances for Werder Bremen. Pizarro was once a team-mate of his there despite being twice his age.\n\"I know him really well. I played with him when he was 17. When I was there, I was the experienced guy. He didn't talk much to me. I tried to talk to him but he was really quiet, but a nice guy. And I could see how he improved. I think that he is something special.\nPizarro adds: \"He has to learn still, because he is really big, but sometimes he does not use his body like he could do, or score many goals with the head. But as I said, he still needs a little bit of time to improve in some things, but I think he is a great player.\"\nThere is a feeling that, for now, that improvement is most likely to happen at Stuttgart where he would remain an important player, starting regularly in both the Bundesliga and in Europe. It is there, at the Swabian club, that he lifted the German Cup in May.\nAt Bayern, there is the prospect of him fitting into the team with Kane, particularly following the injury to Jamal Musiala and the exit of Thomas Muller. \"It could be an option,\" says Pizarro. \"You can see that he can play all around the front half in the pitch.\"\nBut the long-term ambition would be for him to assume Kane's mantle as Bayern's main striker. The question everyone is asking in Germany is when that journey should begin. \"Stuttgart is still a place where he can learn more,\" adds Pizarro. But for how long?\n\"It is a big challenge for him and for Stuttgart because it is a new situation for the player and the club and to manage everything is not easy,\" says Cacau. \"I hope that he can play one more year. And then he can leave for Bayern or maybe a Premier League club.\"\nUntil then, all eyes are on Nick Woltemade's every move.",

        "title": "Conor Hourihane interview: Barnsley boss on how coaching while playing led him to a head coach role at 34",
        "content": "A matter of weeks after captaining Derby to promotion from Sky Bet League One in May 2024, Conor Hourihane was released upon the expiry of his contract.\nAt 33, and having played 85 of a possible 92 league matches during his stay at Pride Park, signing the former Republic of Ireland international was an attractive proposition.\nBut, on a personal level, he found himself at a crossroads - did he continue playing? Or was it time to start exploring the next chapter?\nIn the end, he was able to combine the two options with a player-coach role at Barnsley, for whom he had made over 130 appearances between 2014 and 2017.\nHourihane only played two games, then retired on December 20 last year to become assistant head coach to Darrell Clarke.\nHis mind had already been made up long before.\n\"I didn't want to let go of playing, but the coaching was my drive and my fire,\" he tells Sky Sports .\n\"I came into pre-season and there wasn't really too much hunger to get fit and get firing, and there was more focus and determination around the coaching, so I probably knew from that moment that I wasn't really looking forward to coming in and training and doing the hard runs of pre-season.\n\"I kind of checked out a little bit and my full focus was around the coaching side of it. I knew where I was at pretty early in pre-season.\n\"To be able to call an end to my career on my own terms, in my own way, I was very satisfied by it, let's just say. I wasn't pushed in one direction, it wasn't an injury, it wasn't taken out of my hands. I just thought it was the right time because of what was on the horizon.\n\"I did wonder if I was letting go too early. Was I going to have enough focus with the coaching? Ever since my role started to broaden, there was no time to miss playing - and that's been the case ever since.\"\nClarke was sacked in March, with Hourihane taking charge on an interim basis, before he was handed a two-year contract just over a month later.\nNow, you are probably wondering how he was able to make the transition from active player to permanent head coach - the fourth youngest in the EFL at present - in such a short period of time. And it is a valid point.\nPlanning for life after football has become more prevalent in recent years and Hourihane, who is now studying for his Pro Licence with the FAI, started his journey towards that during a spell at Swansea in 2020/21.\n\"Steve Cooper was my manager there and I thought he was fantastic. How he looked after players, how he was on the training ground and his overall demeanour around coaching intrigued me a lot,\" he says.\n\"He's someone I'm very fond of. I really like his work, really like him as a man and we've met up on quite a few occasions over the last couple of years to pick each other's brains. He's a good friend and I'm very fortunate to have someone like him, someone I can lean on whenever I need to.\n\"There was an opportunity to do coaching badges over Zoom, so I jumped at the opportunity for that and it snowballed into more.\n\"I went to Stourbridge on Thursday nights when life opened back up because they were part-time and I knew the assistant manager there at the time. I live in Birmingham, so it was only about 40 minutes away. Then I coached Aston Villa U16s, then Barnsley U16s.\n\"Non-league really, really interesting. The night before I might text the assistant manager and ask what I had in terms of numbers? What part of the session did he want me to take? Did he want me to take any individuals after training?\n\"Then I'd turn up and, because they're part-time, two or three can't get out of work and one's running late because of traffic because it's peak traffic time. You're learning straightaway how to adapt your session, how to evolve your numbers.\n\"I might have four balls in my session when I probably need 10, but I have to make it work through a certain way of thinking outside the box.\n\"When you go to the academy, you know you're going to have set numbers, set coaches, and everything's going to run relatively smoothly. You get a different satisfaction from that.\"\nThis was all happening while Hourihane was still playing at Derby, who were supportive of their captain's endeavours. In truth, he never gave them any cause for concern.\n\"I pride myself on being a very, very good professional and I knew, every single day when I came in, I had to train properly and do everything right,\" he says.\n\"I just made time. Sometimes I'd come in at seven in the morning, rather than half eight, and sat down with one of the analysts because I need to look at some training sessions or I needed to do an assignment for my A Licence.\n\"When training was over, then it was my time maybe to switch my focus away from my playing onto coaching, like someone might do if they've got a pastime of playing golf or music or whatever it might be.\n\"It was a relentless cycle of how quickly can I improve? How much can I do on the grass to get better? It just became a big road and determination to be as good as I can, as early as I can.\n\"I was very, very fortunate to have a very supportive home as well that let me go off and do whatever I needed to do to end up right here in this position.\"\nThe 34-year-old has only been in the job, on a permanent basis, for four months, but he has found his biggest learning curve to date to be one he gave little thought to as a player.\n\"There haven't been too many curveballs yet, but if I had to pinpoint one thing, it would probably be the fact I do so much work to be as prepared as possible to get the lads in a really good place and then, ultimately, it doesn't guarantee you a win and it doesn't guarantee you a result,\" Hourihane explains.\n\"Early on, I found it quite difficult to accept that. I got better at that a little bit as the role moved forward into the end of the season, understanding you can give yourself a real good chance, but does it coincide with your guarantee to win? Obviously not or else everyone would do it the same way.\"\nYou can be sure he has not had that feeling yet this season.\nBarnsley sit third in League One after four league games, having won three and drawn one, with their most recent result a 1-0 victory away at Peterborough.\n\nThey are also through to the second round of the Carabao Cup after a penalty shootout win over Fleetwood.\nAt present, Sky Bet have them priced as 20/1 outsiders for the title, but 11/2 to win promotion, either by winning the title, finishing as runners-up or winning the play-offs.\nThat type of talk is premature, of course. Hourihane's focus for now is to justify his appointment.\n\"I'm very fond of the football club. I'm very fond of the opportunity they've given me and I want to repay them with doing this in my way and in the way that brings winning games of football,\" he adds.\n\"Right now, the philosophy is to be aggressive and high-pressing and then, when we win the ball back as quickly as possible, we control the game with the ball and in a certain structure around that that everyone has clarity on as well.\n\"Hopefully now we get that little bit of luck on match days and we start getting results to back up the work that we're doing.\"",

        "title": "Eberechi Eze Q&A: How Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur to Crystal Palace winger and what he can bring to Emirates",
        "content": "With Eberechi Eze heading for boyhood club Arsenal after the Gunners stole a march on north London rivals Spurs - who looked certain to sign him - what's the full story in yet another dramatic saga in one of the most memorable transfer windows ever?\nAt the start of Wednesday morning, Tottenham believed they had a deal agreed for the 27-year-old to join them for £67.5m, including add-ons.\nBut then in stepped Arsenal - who had previously had an interest in the England winger - to gazump them at the final hurdle.\nIt leaves Gunners fans delighted, their left-wing problems seemingly sorted and Spurs supporters, naturally, in a state of shock at losing out on a major summer signing to their closest rivals.\nHow has it all played out so far, and what's next for Arsenal, Spurs and Eze?\n\nSky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:\nI have some sympathy for Spurs. This is not Football Manager, this is real life. I don't want to kick Spurs when they're down - I'm trying to see it from the perspective of their hierarchy.\nI think they did everything they could to try to sell the club to Eze. A lot of Spurs fans are asking why they didn't trigger his release clause before Friday, but maybe they tried to do that and the player could've dragged his feet. Maybe he was keeping his options open.\n\nSpurs fans are very angry and criticising Daniel Levy and the owners, but I think we should keep things in perspective; these kinds of things happen all the time in the window.\nUltimately, everyone knows Eze is an Arsenal fan, as are his whole family. He played for them until he was 13 when he was released.\nIs this move motivated by the fact that Kai Havertz picked up this knee injury?\nOr have they been really smart and avoided getting involved in a bidding war? They knew he would choose Arsenal if he had a choice - and waited for Spurs to agree a deal before they turned up at the 11th hour and matched it. I think it's a bit of both.\nToday's a great day to be an Arsenal supporter. They have pulled off a real coup here. At the last minute, they matched Spurs' offer, and it's important to remember Eze himself is an Arsenal supporter.\n\nHis wish was very important in this - Arsenal matched Spurs' bid of £60m including £7.5m in add-ons. Remember, he had a release clause which expired last week which was worth up to £68m.\nArsenal have been interested in signing him all summer and their fans were crying out for them to make a move for him.\nWhen you looked at how much business they had already done this summer you could suggest they had to sell before they brought in another player.\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's previous release clause, of £68.5m - only £1m more than Arsenal are set to pay - expired last Friday.\nSpeaking after Sunday's 0-0 draw at Chelsea, which Eze started, Glasner said: \"I'm quite calm, but I also know we have two weeks to go, and I know Ebs' clause is gone, so it's the club's decision, and we will see what happens.\"\nTottenham could have guaranteed they would have their offer accepted earlier in the window by hitting that target, but only agreed a fee for Eze after it had already expired.\nSo why didn't they try to trigger it? \"It might've needed paying in one lump sum, said Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol. \"They might've waited until it expired to get a better deal.\"\nSky Sports News' Michael Bridge:\nTottenham Hotspur moved on from Eberechi Eze once it became clear he wanted to join Arsenal and they are now focusing on other targets.\nSpurs want to sign a No 10, a winger and a centre back ahead of the deadline.\nSeveral recent reports have linked Spurs with Tyler Dibling, but this is long-standing interest. There is interest in Monaco's Maghnes Akliouche.\nIt could be a very busy final few weeks at Spurs and clubs are aware they are prepared to pay £60m on the desired player after missing out on Morgan Gibbs-White and Eze for similar fees.\nSpurs feel they couldn't have done any more on both failed deals.\nSky Sports' Ron Walker:\nLast season, Arsenal's biggest difficulty was breaking down teams with a low block. They won only seven of 17 games where they had at least 60 per cent of the ball - picking up almost 0.4 points per game fewer than when they didn't.\nIn among his array of attacking talents, Eze has built a reputation as a defence breaker. Not only a technical marvel and excellent in one-on-one duels, he was one of the Premier League's best in delivering passes which broke opposition backlines last season. Only four players completed more take-ons across the Premier League in 2024/25.\nHe fits the bill for the defensive work rate Mikel Arteta demands, too. Eze won the ball back in the middle and defensive third more than almost any other attacking player in the Premier League last season.\nSky Sports' Paul Merson:\nEze is a brilliant signing for Arsenal. It's a game-changer and a perfect fit. If Arsenal had let Spurs get him, I'd have had to question what the club was doing because he's a quality player.\nArsenal struggle when teams come to the Emirates and put everyone behind the ball. Teams want to limit the space Arsenal have to play in and they have struggled to break teams down with those tactics.\nWe've seen it over the last few years where they have struggled to break teams down when it gets right to the business end of a game and the business end of a season.\nFor me, that's where Eze comes in at Arsenal. He's got the X-factor and in tight games, he has the ability to break a low block down.\nAway from home, maybe he's not the answer. Against the likes of Liverpool and Man City, they may come under the cosh for a bit, and they may have to play slightly differently.\nBut that's why you have a big squad. At home, against the lesser teams, where they have 70 to 80 per cent of the ball, let Eze go and do what he wants because he will make something happen.\nI think Arsenal win the league with Eze.\nThey had a chance without him because it's a real heads or tails season with Liverpool, and Man City played well on the opening weekend, but Eze helps get them over the line.\nSky Sports' Ron Walker:\nIf this late move for Eze is motivated by Havertz's injury, it stands to reason it will be someone else adding to their striking ranks because, bar a brief cameo as a false nine for England against Senegal earlier this summer, it's not a position where Eze has often featured.\nIt may instead mean a role change for Gabriel Martinelli, however. In fairness, the Brazilian has barely played through the middle in six years at the Emirates either, but it has long been seen as his eventual position by many Arsenal fans.\nHe was utilised as a No 9 against Liverpool late last season, more through necessity than design, but he showed a glimpse of what he can offer to supplement Viktor Gyokeres, Gabriel Jesus and Havertz as an option in spearheading Arsenal's attack.\nAfter his goalscoring exploits at Anfield, Gary Neville told Sky Sports : \"I actually think in the last half of this game Martinelli showed he actually could be a really dangerous centre-forward with his runs in behind.\"",

        "content": "Nicolas Jackson will not be part of Chelsea's matchday squad for the trip to West Ham on Friday, amid interest from Aston Villa.\nBlues boss Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker's absence in his press conference on Thursday morning.\n\"He [Jackson] is available, but he's not going to be part of the squad,\" Maresca said.\n\"We have two strikers, two players in that position and also we know something can happen before the transfer window closes.\n\"No idea [if a move away is close]. I prefer to be focused on training sessions and preparing for the game. I don't know.\"\nVilla are understood to have explored the conditions of a deal for the 24-year-old, who played under head coach Unai Emery at Villarreal.\nJackson told Chelsea earlier this month that he wants to consider his options during the transfer window. Chelsea signed strikers Joao Pedro and Liam Delap this summer.\nJackson was absent from Chelsea's squad for friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan ahead of the Premier League season.\nThe striker served the final game of a suspension in Chelsea's first fixture of the season against Crystal Palace.\nJackson scored 13 goals in 37 appearances across all competitions last season, having netted 17 in 44 during his first year at the club.\nChelsea have sold a host of players this summer, with another nine likely to leave, while Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons top targets to bolster their attacking line.\nSky Sports' Paul Merson on The Premier League Show:\n\"I like Jackson, I've seen a lot of him. He's a bit messy and his touch will be poor - but I'd love to play with him. The position I played in, I'd love to have played with him because he opens games up. If I were Aston Villa or Newcastle, I'd buy him all day long. He goes the other way, and on a big pitch like Newcastle's, you could get Bruno Guimaraes or Sandro Tonali more on the ball.\n\"If you asked a lot of defenders, I reckon after the game - even though he is messy and needs more coaching - I don't think there would be too many centre-halves who would say: that was easy. He gives you a hard time, he's willing to run.\n\"I'm pretty shocked with Chelsea. He made Cole Palmer and Palmer made Jackson. They worked as a pair and really stretched the game and it got Palmer on the ball and let him do his stuff.\n\"Now I don't see that. Joao Pedro wants to come short and compresses Palmer's game. I know we're one game in, but Palmer is going further and further back to get the ball. You don't want him there, you want him around the box as he can weave his magic as he is the X factor.\n\"I don't think this is a great move for Chelsea. I think it's a mistake. Jackson could come back to haunt them if he went to Newcastle or Villa, by scoring a few goals.\"\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\nJackson's future will be resolved when it becomes clear whether Alexander Isak is staying at or leaving Newcastle United.\nThere are up to six clubs interested in signing Jackson and Chelsea are expecting significant bids when there is more clarity about Isak's future.\nAston Villa are one of the interested clubs, but it remains to be seen whether they would be able to afford the asking price.\nJackson's value will be determined by the market price paid for strikers by Premier League clubs this summer.\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\nChelsea are close to agreeing a deal to sell Renato Veiga to Villarreal in a deal expected to be worth £26m (€30m).\nThe defender joined Chelsea last summer from Basel for £12m on a contract until June 2031.\nHe scored two goals in 18 appearances before spending the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, where he played 15 times.\nVeiga was also called up to the Portugal squad after signing for Chelsea and has earned five caps.\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\nFulham are considering making a move to sign Raheem Sterling from Chelsea, but a deal appears unlikely at the moment.\nSterling is expected to leave Chelsea this summer after spending last season on loan at Arsenal.\nHe has been training away from the first-team squad and did not travel to the United States for the Club World Cup.\nChelsea signed him from Manchester City three years ago in a £47.5m deal and he has two years left on his contract.\nSterling has not played for Chelsea since he scored against Bournemouth in the final game of the 2023/24 season.\nIn\nJamie Gittens - Dortmund, £51.5m\nJoao Pedro - Brighton, £60m\nLiam Delap - Ipswich, £30m\nJorrel Hato - Ajax, £38.5m\nEstevao Willian - Palmeiras, £29m\nDario Essugo - Sporting, £18.5m\nMamadou Sarr - RC Strasbourg, £12m\nKendry Paez - Independiente del Valle, £17.3m\nOut\nKendry Paez - Strasbourg, loan\nDjordje Petrovic - Bournemouth, £25m\nBashir Humphrey - Burnley, undisclosed\nDylan Williams - Burton, undisclosed\nMarcus Bettinelli - Man City, undisclosed\nKepa Arrizabalga - Arsenal, £5m\nTeddy Sharman-Lowe - Bolton, loan\nMathis Amougou - Strasbourg, undisclosed\nZak Sturge - Millwall, undisclosed\nNoni Madueke - Arsenal, £52m\nCaleb Wiley - Watford, loan\nMike Penders - RC Strasbourg, loan\nJoao Felix - Al Nassr, £43.7m\nIshe Samuels-Smith - Strasbourg, £6.9m\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall - Everton, £29m\nMamadou Sarr - Strasbourg, loan\nLeo Castledine - Huddersfield, loan\nLesley Ugochukwu - Burnley, undisclosed\nMarc Guiu - Sunderland, loan\nArmando Broja - Burnley, £20m\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

Eze's Arsenal medical could take place as soon as Friday.\nMerson insists Eze moving to Arsenal is a \"game-changer\" with the former Gunner suggesting the England international could be a key figure in breaking down stubborn defences, particularly at Emirates Stadium.\n\"Eze is a brilliant signing for Arsenal,\" Merson said. \"It's a game-changer and a perfect fit.\n\"If Arsenal had let Spurs get him, I'd have had to question what the club was doing because he's a quality player.\n\"Arsenal struggle when teams come to the Emirates and put everyone behind the ball.

The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself.\nHe finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first ever major honour.\nLast season wasn't all plain sailing, though. \"I think Ebere has had a strange season,\" said Palace boss Glasner at the end of March. \"He hasn't had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He's also struggled with strange injuries.\"\nThose comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in a FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in.\nIt is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta.\nAfter being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second chance in north London - and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Mikel Arteta.\nWatch Arsenal vs Leeds on Saturday night Football on Sky Sports; kick-off 5.30pm\n\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "On the day he was appointed Rangers head coach, Russell Martin admitted: \"I have to try and convince people that I'm the right person.\"\nHe also acknowledged that \"we need to find a way to win whilst we're developing\", as he hoped to create some \"energy and momentum\".\nHowever, there have been more draws and defeats than wins, while 'anxiety and stuttering' seem more accurate than the positive 'energy and momentum' Martin wanted.\nHis first eight competitive matches as Rangers boss have left many supporters with more questions than answers, and some even questioning if he should remain in his post.\nThat outlook is premature, with Martin himself acknowledging \"the club's bounced around with different ideas, different plans, been hinged on emotion, making decisions just on a quick reaction. So now we have owners and a leadership team that understand where the club's been and where it's at and where it needs to go to, but they also understand that's not going to come without a bit of pain.\"\nMartin insists he is \"enjoying\" his time at Ibrox and wants to be \"judged in May\", adding \"by then we'll be in a really good place\". However, when you look at the recent managerial tenures at Ibrox - he knows to last until May, things need to improve, both in performances and results.\nIn short, and on the whole, they have been disappointing.\nRangers got things underway by progressing past Panathinaikos in their opening Champions League qualifier - but they rode their luck at times.\nThat luck continued into their opening league game of the season, but not how you may expect. Martin admitted his team \"were lucky to get a point\" at Fir Park, before slamming the attitude and mentality of his players as they drew 1-1.\n\nThe jeers of Fir Park did turn into cheers at Ibrox days later as Martin got the reaction he wanted during a brilliant 3-0 win over Viktoria Plzen in their next European encounter. Many fans expected their team to kick on and progress. They are still waiting.\nIt took an injury-time James Tavernier penalty to snatch a draw at home to Dundee, a result again met with boos from the crowd. They lost in the Czech Republic but progressed past Plzen thanks to that first-leg win and they were unconvincing again as they struggled past third-tier Alloa Athletic at Ibrox in the League Cup.\n\nOf their three wins to that point, two came in Europe at home - so fans had hope they could get a result against Club Brugge in their Champions League play-off first-leg.\nThat hope was extinguished after just seven minutes when Rangers were 2-0 down, and it looked like things could get ugly when it was 3-0 with 20 minutes on the clock. Rangers did rally and pulled one goal back in the second half, but it was that first-half performance that has left fans with concerns heading into a huge couple of weeks.\nA lot was made of Martin's style and philosophy before he took the job at Ibrox. Questions were raised if it would work against a low block that Rangers often face domestically. Fans were also worried he would not adapt during games if plan A didn't work.\nWell, the first eight games have not done much to quell those concerns.\n\nThere are new partnerships across the backline that need time to gel. However, at times they have been far too open and required big saves from goalkeeper Jack Butland.\nIn half of those games, the opposition have managed to take more shots at the Rangers goal than Martin's side had in the match. Panathinaikos managed 34 across both legs, Motherwell had 14 in the league opener and Viktoria Plzen managed 14 at Ibrox, plus 27 in the away tie. It is a worrying trend.\nAlthough there were some unnerving moments, the performance against Viktoria Plzen at Ibrox was more of what Martin and the fans have wanted. Rangers were aggressive, showed high levels of intensity with the ball, they attacked their opponents, there were plenty of runs in behind and there were goals.\nConsistency is the next requirement. Aside from an expected win over third-tier Alloa in the cup, Rangers are yet to taste victory since that performance. There's no doubt going forward - with new signings Djedi Gassama and Oliver Antman on the wing - that Rangers fans could be entertained. However, they need a complete display at both ends of the park.\nIt has been an eventful four weeks or so as Martin's side were thrown into the deep end across three competitions. However, the month will be even more crucial.\nThree huge league games await, featuring a game against St Mirren that Rangers initially wanted called off to better prepare for Europe. That went out the window when they fell behind their rivals after just two games. Then it's a huge first Old Firm clash of the season at Ibrox and after the international break, Hearts visit Ibrox as they bid to split the Old Firm this season.\nAlongside that, there's the second leg of that Club Brugge tie which will determine the European competition Rangers feature in. If they can turn it around, the riches of the Champions League await. If not, the familiar path of the Europa League lie ahead.\nAt the end of the upcoming stretch of games is their League Cup quarter-final against Hibernian. Silverware is a must at Rangers, so the importance of that won't be lost on the fans and squad.\nSky Sports News' Gordon Duncan:\n\"The first half against Club Brugge was an absolute disaster. Russell Martin speaks about knowing there will be a bit of pain. For Rangers fans, there is just too much pain in the early stages. It is one thing losing but the manner of it and the capitulation early on, fans leaving midway through the first half, booing at half-time and full-time. The second half got better, and on paper, they've kept the tie alive but it feels like the start to the game is what Rangers fans will cling onto. It is not in isolation either, dropping points to Motherwell and Dundee in the Scottish Premiership, even some of the games in Europe and the League Cup win - Rangers have not been at their fluent best. This felt like an accumulation for Rangers fans and the frustration was clear for all to see and hear.\n\n\"Russell Martin will look at the fixtures ahead and see it as an opportunity to turn things around but it is a very tricky fixture list. The Club Brugge tie is still to come, but before that going away to St Mirren on Sunday. Rangers were going to postpone that game to give themselves the best chance of navigating the European ties but then things became tricky in the league, they fell behind the decision to postpone that game and it was put on the back burner. It is a notoriously difficult place to go.\n\"After those games, it is the date all fans have circled, August 31 - Celtic at Ibrox. We all know that is about more than just the three points.\n\"The next few weeks could be crucial for Rangers. If you are a glass-half-full optimist like Russell Martin, you see it as a chance to show what you are capable of. If you are a glass-half-empty type, you might see Rangers' season being all but over by that point. It is a vital period coming up.\"\n\nFollowing the defeat to Club Brugge, former Rangers striker Kris Boyd on Sky Sports:\n\"Rangers have got a huge league game on Sunday in Paisley [against St Mirren].\n\"There are so-called leaders within that Rangers team to lead by example but they never done that in the first-half against Club Brugge. It was embarrassing - to be 2-0 down after seven minutes and 3-0 down after 20 minutes - there is nothing to be positive about for Rangers after that game.\n\"The sad thing about it is, it is the same mistakes that seem to be happening time after time for Rangers. People not doing their jobs, not playing as a team collectively and looking after themselves. That would be a worry. For any team, it doesn't how good you are - you have to work as a team, be hard to beat. I don't think this Rangers team have got that. They are so open and easy to play through.\"\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports News, Rangers podcaster and author Martyn Ramsay said:\n\"He had to hit the ground running for thousands of fans who pretty much made up their mind immediately. If he is to turn this around, it would be one of the most remarkable stories in the club's history.\n\"If we lose the Old Firm game and there is a disaster in the League Cup, it will feel that way [that the season is over].\n\"The Club Brugge game felt like the end of days that we've experienced over the past few years, with fans reaching the end of their patience, but on August 19. To detached readers, that will be ridiculous but that is just life here.\n\n\"If you are going to try rip up a culture that is weak, and it really has not been good enough for some time, and move to a style of football that the new owners want - that is not going to be done in jig time.\n\"Rangers' recruitment looks okay in some of the most supplementary areas of the pitch, especially out wide. However, we still lack a core spine of players from goalkeeper to number nine that are reliable, consistent, confident, inspire the rest of the dressing room and make dressing rooms around the country realise this is a game changer. I don't care who the manager is - without that spine throughout the team, this can't be changed.\n\"I think the fans have made their minds up [over Russell Martin]. They will change if results change, that is the nature of football fandom. However, the conversations I am in on a daily basis - I have been used to that after a manager has had a year and it has not worked out and you get to the end of that cycle, not after a few weeks.\n\"What has changed and is going to be very interesting… the previous owners were wealthy fan investors and would always respond to fan pressure. I wonder if [the new owners] with that sense of detachment if they will say no, we know the situation here, we know how long this will take and we are going to hang fire.\"",

        "title": "Celtic: What next for Brendan Rodgers and the board as fan frustrations increase? | 'We lack ambition'",
        "content": "\"It's normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung.\"\nChants of sack the board echoed around Celtic Park after their Champions League play-off draw with Kairat Almaty , with Brendan Rodgers suggesting he could be the one made to leave.\nThere is unrest from the fans due to a lack of summer transfer business, with Rodgers pointing out the failure to strengthen before their first leg was \"not my decision\" and conceded he has to \"accept where it's at\".\n\nBut given Celtic have won their first two Premiership games, have progressed in the League Cup and are just 90 minutes from European football's elite club competition, are things really as bad as the supporters believe?\nCeltic have made seven summer signings, with three being free transfers, and they are yet to replace some notable departures.\nKieran Tierney returned to Parkhead while goalkeeper Ross Doohan is also back at the Hoops on a three-year deal after leaving Aberdeen.\nCeltic have also signed winger Benjamin Nygren from FC Nordsjaelland in a deal worth around £2m, defender Hayato Inamura has joined from Albirex Niigata and Shin Yamada has moved from J-League side Kawasaki Frontale .\nThe club also secured the signing of teenage forward Callum Osmand on a free from Fulham with Jahmai Simpson-Pusey joining on a season-long loan from Manchester City.\nWinger Nicolas Kuhn left for Como earlier this month, Kyogo Furuhashi's successor is yet to be found after his January departure and Jota is expected to miss a large spell of this campaign through injury.\nAnd could a right-back now be on the wanted list after Alistair Johnston was stretchered off during Wednesday night's game with a hamstring injury?\nRodgers' post-match comments once again highlighted the strained relationship he has with the board. He has entered the final year of his deal and, while he is \"200 per cent\" ready to see out this season, he has already said he is 'not the right guy' to just maintain something .\n\"You know these games are tough games and you want to have your best players in and have players in as quick as you can to tackle these sorts of situations,\" he said after the disappointing draw.\n\"But listen, it is what it is and I just have to accept where it's at and we'll now get ready for Saturday and then the long haul on Sunday.\n\"We need to improve the squad. There was clarity around that for a long time.\n\"So we see that. I think supporters see that. We certainly do in football. We need to improve.\n\"This is a performance club. This is a club that has to perform. And that starts on the field. You do that with getting the very best players you possibly can to allow you to perform.\"\n\nAsked about the fans' reaction, the Northern Irishman said: \"I do know that, over many years, 'sack the board' normally means 'sack the manager'.\n\"It's normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung.\n\"I can only really look at the players we have here, and the performance.\n\"We've known for a long time what we've needed as a squad, so I don't want to go into that.\"\n\nRodgers wants to be the best, he makes no secret of that. Challenging in the Champions League is his next target with Celtic.\nThe Scottish champions reached the knockout phase of the tournament last season for the first time in 12 years after losing just twice in eight games in the league format, and were then seconds away from extra-time against Bayern Munich.\nAfter that impressive showing in the Allianz Arena, the 52-year-old outlined his belief that they could reach the next stage of the competition . Fast-forward six months and they have so far failed to strengthen for that possibility.\nCeltic podcaster Paul John Dykes told Sky Sports News the supporters are right to be concerned.\n\"Brendan Rodgers is the only spokesperson at Celtic at the moment, I think he's becoming frustrated answering the same questions every day when it comes to recruitment.\n\"Why can't we get the deals over the line? This is a big issue.\n\"As fans, I think we're balanced. I think they look at it and say, well, some players will be hedging their bets to see if Celtic get into the Champions League proper and I totally understand that, but Celtic need to be decisive in the transfer market.\n\"I think that we lack ambition. I don't think that the boardroom has the same ambition as Brendan Rodgers and certainly the same ambition as a lot of the fans.\n\"It was clear for everyone to see that we were at that cusp, we were seconds away from taking Bayern Munich into extra time that night.\n\"We could all see as fans where we had to strengthen and we've still not strengthened seven months later and that's hugely frustrating.\"\nThere is no doubt the silence from the Celtic board has been deafening.\nChief executive Michael Nicholson and chairman Peter Lawwell are at almost every game, but neither have addressed any of the issues raised by the manager or the fans.\nThere is also majority shareholder Dermot Desmond. Rodgers was his appointment but even he must realise he is losing faith with the desire to take the club to the next level.\nPeterborough owner Darragh MacAnthony believes there is a simple way to ease the tension. Communication.\n\"I always say, just be transparent,\" he told Sky Sports News .\n\"If you've got an issue as a club or you don't want to spend £100m you've got sitting there, just tell them why.\n\"Just say to the fans, look, we need a bit of patience. We can't quite get deals done. People maybe have turned us down. We can't hit those wage metrics because it would then affect the rest of the squad.\n\"Just come out and talk to the fans.\"",

        "title": "Jeremie Frimpong injury: Liverpool defender ruled out until after the international break, missing Newcastle and Arsenal games",
        "content": "Liverpool defender Jeremie Frimpong has been ruled out until after the September international break.\nThe Dutch right-back - who limped off during the Premier League opener against Bournemouth - will miss Liverpool's crucial games against Newcastle on Monday, and Arsenal on the following Sunday. Both games are live on Sky Sports .\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"The medical team was completely right about Jeremie, to tell me I had to take him off because he's out until the end of the international break.\n\"I think I got criticised a bit by taking him off. [The medical staff] felt he had an issue in his hamstring. Good call to take him off otherwise he might have been out for longer. We expect to have him back after the international break.\"\n\nConor Bradley returned to training with the first team on Thursday while Joe Gomez is another right-back option in the squad - but Slot said he has not played a lot of minutes, raising doubts about his ability to start.\n\"Conor played for a few minutes with us today, for the first time,\" said Slot, who revealed Wataru Endo and Dominik Szoboszlai could also fit in at right-back. Curtis Jones has also slotted in at right-back before for Liverpool and England.\n\"These things happen in a season. We have only at the moment two injuries - unfortunately it's two for the same position,\" added Slot.\n\"The good thing is some others can play in that position as well. Wataru played in that position for a few minutes, Dominik Szoboszlai already played in that position. There are other options we can explore.\n\"Joe Gomez is definitely one of them. But for him to already play 20 minutes, that was already quite a lot. I wouldn't say he had a setback but he wasn't able to train three days in a row completely with the team. It's completely normal if you've been out for so long and all of a sudden the manager needs you for 20 minutes.\n\"He's training with the team so let's see where he is on Monday, if he can be involved in the team or if he can even start. But there are other options as well.\n\"You cannot prepare for two injuries in one position. It would be stupid for us to have three full-backs or five left-backs - although we have three left-backs!\"\nSky Sports' Paul Merson on The Premier League Show:\n\"You worry for those two games coming up. The way they play, they let [Mohamed] Salah stay up top and he doesn't have to be tracking back.\n\"And now with Harvey Barnes probably playing out on that wing for Newcastle, then either Eberechi Eze or Gabriel Martinelli playing there the week after, they will have to get through those next two games.\n\"That gives the other two teams a chance.\n\"I was at the Community Shield the week before and I was worried about Liverpool defensively. Frimpong likes bombing forward and Salah is staying up the pitch. There's always going to be space down their right and the opposition's left. I worry for Liverpool down there.\n\"If Frimpong's injured and Bradley is fit - it's probably the right move for them in the next two games who have ammunition down that side of the pitch.\n\"Bradley isn't fit yet, Gomez has had a few injuries so it's only right you look after him. So it will be interesting. That's where you can hurt Liverpool, anywhere else I'm not too sure.\"\nLiverpool received some criticism for their defending in the season opener against Bournemouth, with Jamie Carragher calling it \"absolutely shocking\".\nHowever, the Reds will be boosted by the return of midfielder Ryan Gravenberch , who was suspended last Friday following a red card on the final day of last season.\n\"If he's the same player as he was last season that could help us a lot,\" said Slot of Gravenberch.\n\"If you look at the second goal we conceded [against Bournemouth] they could go from one side to the other side without being attacked. If you look back at last season, every single time Ryan played, he would have been in that position.\n\n\"For him not being there and us playing with very good players but very attacking-minded players, that for example hurt us in that goal. And that wasn't the first time where we lacked a player in that position in a counter-attack for the other team.\"\nAnalysis by Sky Sports' Richard Morgan:\nLiverpool head coach Arne Slot will have various options to pick from to replace the injured Jeremie Frimpong at right-back after the Netherlands international suffered a hamstring injury in the champions' opening-night win over Bournemouth, although none of them are ideal.\nFrimpong will be out until after the international break, meaning Slot now needs cover for the upcoming Premier League games at Newcastle United on Monday Night Football , followed by the huge clash with title rivals Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday August 31.\nConor Bradley would be the natural choice, but the right-back has only just returned to training after his own hamstring issue saw him return early from the club's preseason tour of the Far East.\nThe experienced Joe Gomez , meanwhile, would be another option, but like Bradley, the versatile defender is also only just back from an Achilles injury that cut short his summer tour of Hong Kong and Japan. And while Gomez did come on for the final 18 minutes against Bournemouth, Slot indicated that Monday's trip to St James' Park may come too soon for him, at least to start the game.\nAnd that could see the Dutchman having to convert a midfield player into a right-back, with the likes of Wataru Endo - who initially replaced Frimpong on Friday Night Football , before Gomez took over in the role - Dominik Szoboszlai , or most likely Curtis Jones - who was used there against Everton and Fulham during a similar injury crisis last April, while Thomas Tuchel also played him there in his first game as England boss - all candidates.\nUnless, of course, Slot opts to try recent new centre-back signing Giovanni Leoni out in an unfamiliar right-back role, as he did with Jarell Quansah in last season's League Cup final loss to Newcastle at Wembley.\nBut whoever he goes for, trying to tame Newcastle's pacy left-sided forward Harvey Barnes under the St James' lights will be no easy task.\nAugust 25: Newcastle (A), Premier League, kick-off 8pm, live on Sky Sports\nAugust 31: Arsenal (H), Premier League, kick-off 4.30pm, live on Sky Sports\nSeptember 14: Burnley (A), Premier League, kick-off 2pm, live on Sky Sports\nSeptember 16-18: First Champions League game of the season\nSeptember 20: Everton (H), Premier League, kick-off 12.30pm\nSeptember 27: Crystal Palace (A), Premier League, kick-off 2pm",

        "content": "Oliver Glasner insists Marc Guehi has to stay at Crystal Palace for at least their Conference League play-off second leg and says the club should have replaced Eberechi Eze earlier in the window.\nLiverpool are interested in signing Guehi, who has entered the final year of his contract, while Eze is set to move to Arsenal after the clubs agreed a £67.5m deal on Wednesday.\nGlasner admitted that Palace knew there was a \"high chance\" that Eze would leave this summer and that \"we missed replacing him early. That's completely our fault and nobody else's fault.\"\nWith less than two weeks of the window to go, a blunt Glasner also added: \"We are very, very late. It's 10 days to go [until the transfer window closes] to find the right replacements. I think we could have done much better than we did. It's no criticism, it's just telling facts.\"\nGuehi started and captained Palace to a 1-0 victory in the first leg of their Conference League tie against Fredrikstad on Thursday night, but the registration deadline has since passed, meaning no new signings can feature in the second leg next week.\nGlasner joked he is considering filling in at centre-back if Guehi were to leave before the match on August 28, four days before the window closes on September 1, amid his concerns over the lack of depth in his squad.\n\"Today, we had 17 on-field players available. One from the academy, two players we already told that they should leave the club. So that means we're with 14 and having six games from the 10th of August until the 31st.\n\"This group, I know we can rely on them. I trust them completely. But it's really not the best way you should start into the season. With the results, third game, no defeat, that's all good. But I think we are below the edge.\n\"I just know if Marc leaves and is not available for Frederikstad, we will have big troubles. That's pretty clear. We can't register anyone. So from my side, he has to stay.\n\n\"We played with Jeff Lerma in the back today. He's a midfield player. We have no centre-back available at the moment. If Marc leaves, I will try my boots because I was a centre-back, and this could be a good option. I will think about it.\"\nBut in contrast, Parish said: \" If Marc wants to sign a contract, then he can stay!\n\"It is a difficult situation. If you are in Europe, the financial rules are a lot tighter than in the Premier League.\n\"Players leaving on a free is not ideal. We will have to look at it over the next 11 days.\"\nGlasner also hit out at Palace over not replacing Eze sooner.\n\"I can't do anything. I can't sign the players. I can't sign a player's contract. So we have to act. We need this. This is Crystal Palace's future,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to add not numbers. It's easy to add 10 numbers. We need the right players. The profile is defined for months. It's not surprising for everyone that Ebs left. Honestly, it's not surprising.\n\"Five days earlier, we couldn't have done anything if he leaves. We knew that the chance was very high that this would happen. Honestly, and I say it like it is, we missed replacing him early enough. That's completely our fault and nobody else's fault.\"\nOn Eze's departure, Parish added: \"We have to move past it. He has been fantastic for us and we are pleased he will go on to fulfill his ambitions.\n\"We have to find other players to support the team and Oliver Glasner. We will bring in players, it is about finding the right players.\n\"I don't think Oliver wants too many, I think it is the right number.

        "title": "Arsenal's goals from corners: How can Premier League rivals stop Mikel Arteta and Nicolas Jover's set-piece tactics?",
        "content": "Arsenal have won five corners this season, they have scored from three of them.\nScoring from their first set piece of the season to win the game at Manchester United was a flex of their muscles - but Jurrien Timber scoring from two corners in a 5-0 win over Leeds is simply ludicrous. \"Arsenal's corner and goals count is really special,\" said Gary Neville on Saturday.\nIt is a common sight. Since the 2023/24 campaign, the Gunners have scored 33 goals from corners. No other Premier League team has more than 20 in that time, while Arsenal also have 10 more corner goals than any other major team in Europe.\nArsenal have been regarded as set-piece experts for around 18 months now - but this early flurry of corner goals at the start of this Premier League season is a message to their rivals: put plenty of time and focus on trying to stop this, or they will hurt you.\nSo how can their Premier League rivals even start to think about stopping them?\n\n\nArsenal's corner routine begins like any other - with the taker, normally Rice or Bukayo Saka, putting their arm up in the air so the players in the middle know when to start their combinations.\nBut what those players in the middle are going to do is more unpredictable. Arsenal have had multiple routines but also multiple starting positions. Sometimes the Gunners players group together at the back post but at Old Trafford on Sunday, they all gathered on the edge of the box.\nThe reason why is to make short runs into the box and create momentum for when the ball arrives in the danger zone. But it also creates a bit of chaos, with opposition players being blocked off from trying to defend the ball.\n\"They've done it for a long period of time in terms of the timing - when they start moving, how they move, when they get to the dangerous area, whether it's the front or the back post,\" set-piece coach Marc Orti Esteban told Sky Sports .\nUntil last season, Orti Esteban was a set-piece analyst at Brentford before leaving to oversee New England Revolution's dead-ball department. Working under Keith Andrews, he was tasked with trying to work out how to stop Arsenal from set-pieces.\nAnd his best advice to try to stop that Arsenal chaos? Control it.\n\"It's all about breaking their timing and what they do - they are very good at that,\" Esteban said.\n\"If you can stop that with physicality, stopping their runs, making it hard for them to move like they want to do, then you have a better chance of defending that situation.\n\"It's about being smart and knowing that they can deliver to the front or the back post. So you have to be covered in those areas.\"\nTeams have tried that in the past, putting a big focus on trying to halt Gabriel's run towards the penalty box. The Brazilian defender - who has 17 goals from set-pieces in the last five years - can sometimes be seen hovering in the middle of the penalty area, before attacking the ball with a run from deep.\nThe only issue with using physicality is Premier League referees are clamping down on that this season. There will be stricter punishments for tugging players back in the penalty area. \"I would expect this time next year for there to have been a few more penalties given for holding offences than what we've seen this year,\" said Howard Webb before this season started.\nArsenal will have to focus on that too, as their 'blocking' of defenders will be scrutinised a lot more. So it shows the importance of being street-wise when the Gunners get corners.\nOne of those 'street-wise' moments that Arsenal and their opponents have to monitor is how the Gunners players affect the opposition goalkeeper - a factor Manchester United found out on Sunday.\nGoalkeeper Bayindir was deemed at fault for Calafiori's goal, but there was also some clever play involving William Saliba, with the Arsenal defender leaning into the United shot-stopper.\nLeeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri was also stuck by Saliba for Timber's first goal on Saturday. \"The goalkeeper can't come because of the bodies around him,\" said Neville on co-commentary duty.\n\nDespite the PGMOL looking to clamp down on holding in the box, VAR deem Saliba's interventions as normal football contact.\nWith Arsenal looking to take advantage of every marginal gain a corner brings, this was another rule they managed to bend in their favour - especially given how they like to attack the six-yard box during corners. And it is not the first time Arsenal have tried and benefited from that tactic.\nIn the 3-2 north London derby win at Spurs in 2024, Ben White was seen doing a similar trick on Guglielmo Vicario - giving the Italian goalkeeper a shove - a bounce off the shoulder - so he would be unable to claim the cross, allowing Kai Havertz to nod in a close-range header.\n\nIt has not always worked, especially involving White. The England international tried a similar tactic in a 1-0 win at Leicester in 2023 - holding onto goalkeeper Danny Ward's glove in the hope that VAR would not catch it. But when Leandro Trossard found the net, it was spotted.\n\nBending the rules? Yes - but it is something that is seen a lot in Arsenal's corner routines. So a strong goalkeeper is a must.\nLast season, some teams tried a new defensive corner tactic against Arsenal to help their defenders get to and clear the ball, including their goalkeeper.\nCrystal Palace, Brighton, Monaco and Spurs all left two or three players up on the halfway line, meaning Arsenal were forced to leave a few players back. That not only decreases the number of players in and around the penalty box but also creates space for goalkeepers to come and claim the ball.\n\n\"Usually they come with six running into the six-yard box, causing a lot of noise and trouble\" Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner said last season. \"They are blocking, pushing, and then it looks like every single ball comes to the spot where they expect it.\n\"The Man Utd game against Arsenal [where Arsenal scored twice from corners in a 2-0 win], United had eight players in the six-yard box to defend, and I think they could have conceded five.\n\"We wanted that the box is clearer. It was.\"\nThe only problem? Arsenal still managed to score from a corner against Palace through Havertz. That was because there were fewer defenders on hand to react to the German scoring after the ball came off the post. \"We defended the first ball but we didn't defend the second ball, the rebound,\" said Glasner.\n\"I think it was not an issue of having three players up, it was just that we have to be so sharp in every situation.\"\nAfter Palace tried that tactic, Spurs came to the Emirates and attempted something similar - but ended up conceding a goal from a corner themselves as Gabriel forced a Dominic Solanke own goal. It has not been seen again.\nSo no matter what teams end up coming up with to foil Arsenal, the Gunners keep on scoring. Leeds and their head coach Daniel Farke's side putting a focus on set-pieces themselves this summer, signing solely players who are 5ft 11in and above to be strong at set pieces.\nBut if they still cannot stop Arsenal from corners - who else can?",

There is always two sides to a story. We will see where we are in a week's time. I hope I can work with him again.\"\nHowe spoke fondly of Isak, adding there were no issues between the head coach and player personally, and he was sure the squad would also welcome the striker back into the fold.\n\"I haven't seen him this week. I saw him last week. When I see him, we speak as normal, there's no issues there between us... I'm sure we'll catch up at some stage and hopefully speak soon,\" he added.\n\n\"There's no doubt how the players will feel - they'll feel the same way I do. Alex is an outstanding player and he's a good person, a good character. He wants to succeed in his career.\n\"This has been a difficult situation for him and the players to see us without him. They've handled it really well. But if Alex decided to come back and play for us, the players would welcome him.\"\nHowe also confirmed that Isak will not be involved for a second successive Premier League game against Liverpool on Monday Night Football, adding he would like to see the Sweden international back in action for Newcastle.\n\"No, there's been no change [in Isak's situation],\" he said. \"He won't be part of the squad for this weekend's game.\n\n\"My preference for these things is that it doesn't happen publicly because everything is better dealt with behind closed doors.\n\"But needs must and the club has spoken, probably justifiably so in that moment. Of course [I hope he can be re-integrated]. He is contracted to us, he's our player.\n\"My wish is he would be playing on Monday night with us, but he won't be and that's regrettable, but I want to 100 per cent see him in a Newcastle shirt.\"",

It's normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung.\"\nAhead of Saturday's Scottish Premiership game against Livingston, he was asked if there was a chance the current situation would accelerate an exit before his contract expires next summer.\n\"Absolutely no chance. We've done that one before. It didn't go down well,\" he said.\n\"I said from the first day, and there's no hidden messages, and there's no this and that, I said I'd be here for three years. I'm here for three years.\"\nThe 52-year-old also stressed, despite perceptions about his relationship with the board, that everyone at the club is pulling in the same direction.\n\"People try and look to find that conflict between me and the board or me and whoever,\" he continued.\n\"It really isn't the case. You know, the board here at the football club of over many years managed the financial side of the game and run the club to an impeccable level.\n\"My job here as the football manager is to really drive and demand and for us to live in a cycle where we understand that we will lose some players. But that it doesn't have this massive impact that it seems to sometimes do and that we can just lose big players and then bring in other ones, rather than to wait.\n\"So, that cycle I want us to be in, but there's certainly no conflict.\n\"Everyone at this club, from the board to myself, we want the very, very best for Celtic.\n\"For me, longer term, I don't think so much as the manager. We had the chances over the summer, but I said, now the season starts, I only want to think of the football.\n\"I don't want to think of the contract, just think of the football and that will come away later on if it does.\"\n\nRodgers revealed defender Alistair Johnston will be out for \"about 12 weeks\" after injuring his hamstring in the first leg against Kairat Almaty.\nHe did suggest they would expore internally for his replacement.\n\"He'll probably be about 12 weeks, so he obviously had his scan yesterday, so it's disappointing for him because he's come back and started well, so that's where we're at,\" the manager added.\n\"When you lose any player, especially of that calibre, then of course it is a disappointment, but it'll provide an opportunity for someone to step in.\n\"We know we have Tony [Ralston], I've got young Colby Donovan, who as a young player here has really impressed me over the time I've been back here and in this last 12 months, he's made great strides.\n\"It's always an opportunity for someone, but of course for Ali, we just want to make sure that we're in a really good position in all competitions when he gets back.\n\"My first look is always inside and that's something that will gain more clarity over the next week or so.\"",

There must be someone out there who thinks it's good fun to put the rumours out there.\n\n\"There's been a lot of links and will continue to be. To be very general, I don't want any players who don't want to come to the club.\n\"If they don't want to come here and wear this fantastic badge, we don't want them here. That's very clear, and I imagine the fans feel exactly the same.\n\"That's a key message.\"\nDespite their disappointment so far this summer, bringing in only two new faces in Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus, Frank said he remained confident more arrivals would be forthcoming in the final 10 days of the transfer window.\nHe said: \"Of course, we want to do everything we can to be competitive. We have six very good front players who will be very competitive across all the competitions - and (Dejan) Kulusevski will come back this season, it's probably longer-term with (James) Maddison unfortunately.\n\n\"I'm confident though that we will sign another player before the end of the window. In general, any club wants to sign players as early as possible. If it was that easy, everyone would do it.\n\"I'm a positive guy, I'm not that fearful. I believe something will happen. I know the club is asking extremely hard, and unfortunately we can't go in Waitrose for five minutes and buy two very good players. It's a bit more complicated than that.\n\"I see the club is working hard, Daniel, Vinay and Johan - we're all on board in terms of being on board to see how we can improve.\"\nRicharlison had been mentioned as a potential makeweight in any deal for Eze, despite the Brazilian starting both of Spurs' two games so far - and scoring a superb double in the 3-0 win over Burnley last weekend.\nWhatver the reason behind those reports of his impending departure, Frank gave his own public backing to the forward when asked about his situation at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\"Right now, Richarlison is my starting No 9,\" he said. \"He scored two fantastic goals, had two fantastic games and is the Brazil No 9.\n\"He's a fantastic player, he wants to stay, I want to keep him and there's been no talks about anything else.\"",

        "content": "Sky Sports News has been told co-owner Evangelos Marinakis and the Nottingham Forest bosses are baffled by Nuno Espirito Santo's latest comments, and there has been no intention of sacking him as the club's manager.\nHowever, Nuno's words to the media on Friday, saying his relationship with the Forest owner is \"not the same\" and \"it is not so good as it was [last season]\" have caused some within the club to seriously question the 51-year-old's commitment to the job.\nDespite this, it looks unlikely Nuno will be sacked before Sunday's game with Crystal Palace, live on Sky Sports, unless he resigns from the role.\nSky Sports News understands discussions are happening behind the scenes, and it is a fast-moving situation.\nRegardless of Marinakis's obvious anger, he is keen to try to bring some kind of unity to the fore in time for the fixture against Palace.\nMarinakis does not want further distractions for the squad, which he, and many others, feel is the strongest Forest have had for decades.\nIt is also thought to be unlikely that Nuno will resign without the prospect of a payoff.\nNuno's comments, which sparked the current unrest behind the scenes at the City Ground, from the Forest boss came a week after he said in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports ahead of the opening game that his squad was \"unbalanced\" and \"very, very far\" from being ready for the new season.\n\nSince Nuno said that, Marinakis has sanctioned over £118m worth of spending on four new players in the last week. That level of spending, the Greek billionaire feels, is proof that Nuno still had his full confidence and backing.\nThe root of Nuno's upset is not wholly understood; however, it's thought he has a difficult relationship with Forest's new global head of football, Edu Gaspar, who was appointed last month to oversee the recruitment strategy for Forest and the other clubs in Marinakis' multi-club empire - Olympiakos in Greece and Rio Ave in Portugal.\nNevertheless, despite Edu's arrival, the club structure at the City Ground and Nuno's role have not changed.\nSince Nuno took over in December 2023, while he has had a say in transfer strategy and the players being targeted, his role has been to galvanise and organise that group of players as the head coach in charge of the first team.\nNuno said his relationship with Marinakis is \"not the same\" and admitted \"where there's smoke, there's fire\" in response to reports his position at the club is under threat.\n\"We know each other very well, and we have all been in the industry for a while now,\" he said ahead of Sunday's Premier League game at Crystal Palace.\n\n\"And where there's smoke, there's fire, so I know how things work, but I'm here to do my job. I understand, because I'm worried. I'm the first one to be worried. I'm the first one to be concerned.\"\nWhen questioned about the rift in his relationship with Marinakis, Nuno went on to add: \"I always had a very good relationship with the owner, last season was very close. This season, not so well. No, it's not [good].\n\"I don't know exactly, but I'm being honest with you. I cannot say that is the same, because it's not the same. The reason behind it, I don't know.\n\"I always believe that dialogue and what you say or your opinion, is always valid, because my concern is the squad and the season that we have ahead of us, but our relations have changed.\n\"I'm being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it's not the same.\n\"The reason behind it, I don't know.\n\"The reality is that it is not what it used to be. What it used to be was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it's not so good.\"\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett :\n\"It's bizarre. It's an extraordinary situation at Nottingham Forest. They had a fantastic win on the opening day of the season and are in the Europa League group stages.\n\"All things looked rosy. But suddenly, there are serious doubts about the future of Nuno Espirito Santo as the Nottingham Forest head coach.\n\"Evangelos Marinakis and the Nottingham Forest bosses are baffled by what he had to say to the media. There is no intention of sacking him.\n\"However, those words today have caused people within the club to question his commitment in the job going forward.\n\"It is extraordinary. I understand there is real anger at the timing of this.\n\"The headlines, as I see it, are that there is a growing rift between Marinakis and Nuno.\"",

I hope it does.\"\nWhen asked what the maximum punishment should be, Semenyo said: \"It could be jail time, it could be banned from stadiums for a lifetime, it could be anything along the lines of that, but I feel like there has to be something else.\"\nThe 25-year-old, who thanked the team-mates, opponents and fans who showed him support on the day, also revealed he was subjected to further abuse on social media in the aftermath of the incident.\n\"I feel like in this day and age it just doesn't make sense and we want to know why it keeps happening. It was pretty painful to hear,\" he said.\n\"I got back on the coach and I was just going through my messages. I wanted to reply back to family and friends, to be honest, and then it obviously popped across the screen on Instagram. I was getting racially abused as well, and it's just like straight after the game that's happened.\n\"Someone has felt the need to come online and do that, so that made me angry, to be honest. Why would you want to do that?\"\nAfter the match at Liverpool, Meta told Sky Sports News they are investigating the racist abuse sent to Semenyo on Instagram.\nIt's understood the social media company are removing comments and disabling the offending accounts.\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters warned any form of discriminatory language used inside a football ground will lead to an immediate ejection from the facility, a ban being issued and the individual may face criminal charges.\n\"No Premier League footballer should ever have to, in their workplace or online, suffer that sort of abuse. It is important that we keep saying that,\" Masters told BBC Sport on August 16.\n\"It is a problem for society. It leaks into football and it shouldn't happen in a football stadium. It shouldn't happen online.\n\"It makes people like me and other football people in charge of the game think twice about what else we can do to ensure that these things don't happen in the future.\n\"If you are found to be using discriminatory language inside a football ground you will be ejected, second you will be banned and third you may face criminal charges.\"",

        "title": "West Ham 1-5 Chelsea: Unwanted records, 'scandalous' defending and relegation fears for West Ham",
        "content": "There was \"scandalous\" defending on the pitch and \"sack the board\" chants from supporters leaving the London Stadium early, as West Ham were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea on Friday night.\nFans might wonder how, on an evening where their team were embarrassed by their rivals, no West Ham player was even booked.\nThe disastrous derby - on the back of a bruising 3-0 loss at newly-promoted Sunderland on the opening weekend - has already sparked talk of a relegation battle and under-pressure Graham Potter appears in desperate need of reinforcements before the transfer window closes in just over a week's time.\nBut with problems across the pitch and confidence battered, Potter now has a huge task on his hands to pick up his players before Tuesday's Carabao Cup trip to Wolves to stop this alarming start to the season spiralling out of control.\n\"I know we're only two games in, but that's a squad that's going to be in a relegation fight unless they give the manager some help,\" said Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp. \"They need four, five, six new signings. They haven't got the quality.\"\n\nThey didn't have the application on Friday night, either, with Redknapp slamming the defending from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jean-Clair Todibo in the first half. \"When your players are defending like that you have no chance,\" he said.\nNever before have West Ham conceded eight goals in their first two games of a top-flight season - but it was easy to see how they've managed it this time, with poor marking, a lack of intensity in their own box and an inability to be first or even second to crosses into the box.\nPhysically, the midfield was overpowered by a Chelsea team who only returned for pre-season a little over two and a half weeks ago. It is in desperate need of an injection of energy after also being found out at Sunderland.\n\n\"Fuming\" was the word captain Jarrod Bowen used to sum up his feelings about the whole situation. He had been feeding off scraps for most of the game, trying to make something happen amid his team's largely toothless attacking performance.\n\"We gifted the goals away,\" he said. \"Everyone has to look in the mirror and be brutally honest. We have to have a reaction.\"\nBut how likely is that to come?\nAs well as their record number of goals conceded this season, Potter now has the unwanted record of being the first West Ham manager to fail to reach double figures for points in his first 10 home games.\nHis overall record is the second-worst of any West Ham manager in the Premier League era.\n\"Clearly what we're doing at the moment isn't enough,\" he conceded in a deflated interview with Sky Sports .\nWest Ham fans booed the team off at half-time and the few remaining when the final whistle sounded did the same. They also turned their ire on the club's hierarchy.\nThis summer the club fulfilled their obligation to buy Todibo - who was hooked at half-time when Potter ditched his back-five plan - and paid fees for Malick Diouf and Mads Hermansen, the goalkeeper who was relegated with Leicester last season, spilled a cross for a Chelsea goal and who, according to Redknapp, needs to be taken out of the team.\n\nThe only other additions were the free signings of Kyle Walker-Peters and Callum Wilson.\nWith Mohammed Kudus, Aaron Cresswell, Vladimir Coufal, Lukasz Fabianski, Danny Ings, Kurt Zouma and Michail Antonio gone, it's fair to question whether West Ham's transfer business has left them weaker than they were before.\nThey are certainly in a worse position after Friday night. Alarm bells are ringing - and it's only August.",

        "title": "Viktor Gyokeres off the mark for Arsenal as Man City produce worrying display against Spurs - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nFollowing a difficult debut against Manchester United, Viktor Gyokeres endured more of the same in the first half of Arsenal's meeting with Leeds. There were heavy touches, a snatched shot inside the box and a general over-eagerness to impress.\nBut it only took three minutes of the second half for everything to change. Finally given a chance to run in behind by Riccardo Calafiori's ball over the top, the striker showcased his power and cutting edge, driving inside and sending a low finish past the goalkeeper.\n\"It's clear that Viktor is really dangerous,\" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta in his press conference afterwards. \"That's his superpower. Let's put him as much as possible in those kind of scenarios, because something will happen.\"\nKai Havertz's injury has added to the onus on Gyokeres' shoulders but this was exactly the response Arsenal needed. Clearly, there is still work to do to provide him with the level of service he requires. As at Old Trafford, his touch count was low against Leeds.\nBut his first goal altered the trajectory of his performance and Arteta will hope it serves as the lift-off he needs. The impact on his confidence could certainly be seen in the manner in which he dispatched the late penalty won by the brilliant Max Dowman.\nHe will need that same confidence at Anfield next weekend. But following a short pre-season, he is sharpening up physically too. \"It was important for me to get 90 minutes, get the rhythm and to get to know the team even more,\" he told Sky Sports . \"I felt more comfortable in how we're playing. I think you can see that as well.\" Nick Wright\n\nManchester City fans will have left the Etihad on Saturday with more questions than answers after a performance that was the complete antithesis of last weekend's win over Wolves. Creative, fluid patterns were replaced by unimaginative, misplaced passes.\nJames Trafford's mistake will hit hardest because it led to a goal but he was far from the worst offender. City were sloppy, undone by a team who looked more confident and assured in their specific roles.\nCristian Romero did a number on Erling Haaland. Joao Palhinha, who won more duels than any other player, and Rodrigo Bentancur were more assertive than Tijjani Reijnders and Nico Gonzalez in midfield. Mohammed Kudus more direct in attack.\nDefensively they were excellent, too, drawing particular acclaim from Thomas Frank for a 'top mentality'. No signs of Spursy Spurs here.\nAs for Man City, this is a confusing start. Are they back in contention as title candidates or was matchday one just a ruse? Pep Guardiola insisted his side would \"make the click\" - but offered no assurances as to when that might happen.\nUntil then, we will be left to ponder what this Man City side, complete with its extravagant summer remodel, are truly capable of. Laura Hunter\n\nSome players might be different but the ethos and tactics remain the same for Bournemouth. That is why perhaps the best bit of business the Cherries did this summer was to keep hold of Andoni Iraola. This was very much business as usual for them.\nWolves were swept away at times by the brave Bournemouth press and aggression without the ball. That was on show for the only goal of the game where Tyler Adams robbed Jean‐Ricner Bellegarde in a typical Iraola pressing trap that the visitors fell into. It ended up the game-winning moment. It's this style of football that has played a huge part in the captures of Ben Gannon-Doak and Amine Adli, who offered the home fans a glimpse of his talents in an impressive cameo. With Iraola at the helm, another season of excitement awaits. Lewis Jones\n\nThere was, understandably, some doom and gloom around the Gtech after Brentford saw Bryan Mbeumo leave for Man Utd this summer and then Yoane Wissa also ask to join Newcastle United, a double blow compounded by a limp opening-day loss at Nottingham Forest - but Dango Ouattara's impressive debut in the win against Aston Villa has given the Bees and new head coach Keith Andrews a real spring in their step.\nIt did cost the west London club £42m to replace Mbeumo with the Bournemouth forward, but that looks money well spent on the basis of his match-winning display that saw off Villa on Saturday afternoon to give Andrews his first win as the new Bees boss.\nIt was not just the confident manner in which the 23-year-old took his goal after being played clean through by Igor Thiago's clever flick that caught his boss' eye.\nBut also the way the Burkina Faso international spent much of the rest of the game tracking back, man-marking Lucas Digne and going on to win more duels than any of his team-mates, before rightly receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted late on.\n\"His goal will get the headlines but for me, it was the aspects of the game, the selfless nature of how he approached the game, and knew what was needed to get a result,\" Andrews said after the game.\n\"If he didn't stick to that it would've been very difficult to deal with them. He was amazing in the space of a few days [since joining]. I know he'll be a big player for this club, his attributes are there for everyone to see.\n\"You'll see that more as we get more control of games and feed him a bit more, but the out of possession shift he put in was selfless. I'm not too surprised, right from the first moment I spoke to him I was really impressed with him.\" Rich Morgan\nThe third statistic should worry Aston Villa more than the second because results will not follow until Unai Emery's side can look more dangerous.\nFor a second weekend in a row they were ineffective in front of goal and despite improving after a below-par first 45 at Brentford, managed just a solitary shot on target from their second-half showing.\nEmery pointed out after the game that the backs-to-the-wall shift the Bees put in was reminiscent of each of his side's visits to the Gtech since he took over.\nBut this victory for the hosts ended a six-game unbeaten streak for the Villans. Yes, these are normally tight affairs, but Villa normally have the guile to edge things.\nIt is easy to point to the loss of attacking players since the end of last season but this was still a line-up including Morgan Rogers and Youri Tielemans, with one of the Premier League's most willing runners - and deadliest finishers - in attack.\nOn the odd occasion, patterns of play worked well and they looked dangerous. But something is not clicking, and it's not just a lack of new faces. Ron Walker\n\nIt took until October for all three promoted sides to win a game in the Premier League last season. This season, it has only taken two weeks.\nBurnley, Sunderland and Leeds United have already won half as many home games as last Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton last season, too.\nIt is early days for the newly-promoted trio but all three teams are showing the bravery, determination and quality to secure points in the top-flight.\nWhether or not they can maintain this momentum throughout the course of the entire season remains to be seen. However, the early signs are promising.\nAll three promoted teams dropped back into the Championship last season - that might not be the case this time round. Patrick Rowe\nIt's mid-August and West Ham look like they're heading for a relegation fight. Just two games into the season, alarm bells are ringing and fans made their frustrations felt during the dismal thrashing by Chelsea.\nOn the pitch, there are goalkeeper questions, defensive lapses, a midfield lacking power and a toothless attack.\nOff it, head coach Graham Potter - who has the second-worst record of West Ham managers in the Premier League - is under pressure but can also point to an underwhelming window of transfer business.\nThe 3-0 loss at promoted Sunderland was a terrible start but the 5-1 dismantling by Chelsea will leave their followers wondering where they go next. It needs to be to the transfer market, if they are to significantly shift the way this season is going. Peter Smith",

        "content": "Arsenal have agreed a £67.5m deal to sign Eberechi Eze after hijacking Tottenham Hotspur's move for the Crystal Palace forward.\nThe Gunners will pay a guaranteed £60m plus £7.5m in add-ons for the forward, who completed his Arsenal medical on Saturday.\nEze has agreed terms on a long-term contract with a formal announcement expected soon.\nThe 27-year-old's release clause, worth £60m plus £8m in add-ons, expired before the Premier League season started.\nEze was absent from the Eagles squad as they beat Fredrikstad, in the first leg of their Conference League play-off at Selhurst Park on Thursday but was spotted at the ground after the game by Sky cameras.\n\nSpurs felt they had an agreement in place with Palace and Eze on Wednesday before their north London rivals reignited their interest and swooped in following an injury to Kai Havertz.\nEze was one of a number of players Arsenal looked into in the first few weeks of the window, where, significantly, a lot of the work was carried out in June when they explored the conditions of a deal. Since then, their focus has been on other positions and player departures.\nSpurs were considering offering Richarlison in a deal for Eze. That would have freed up striker space for them to try and sign Yoane Wissa, who played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Wissa still wants to join Newcastle, who had a second bid rejected on Wednesday.\nEze, who started in Palace's draw at Chelsea on Sunday, has two years left on his contract at Selhurst Park.\nArsenal have a long-standing interest in Eze, who was previously on the books of their academy and has said he was a supporter of the club growing up.\nThey explored a potential deal earlier in the window, but chose not to pursue a deal at that stage as they prioritised strengthening other areas of the squad and agreeing new contracts with existing players.\nSpurs then came in for Eze after Morgan Gibbs-White chose to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest and they lost James Maddison to an ACL injury.\nTalks were held between Tottenham and Palace, and Spurs felt they had an agreement in place on Wednesday with club and the player.\nHowever, Arsenal then came in to hijack the deal in a major twist on Wednesday evening.\nSky Sports' Peter Smith:\nEberechi Eze is electric. The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself.\nHe finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first ever major honour.\nLast season wasn't all plain sailing, though. \"I think Ebere has had a strange season,\" said Palace boss Glasner at the end of March. \"He hasn't had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He's also struggled with strange injuries.\"\nThose comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in an FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in.\nIt is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta.\nAfter being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second-chance in north London - and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Mikel Arteta.\n\nSky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:\n\" Arsenal have pulled off a real coup here. At the last minute, they matched Spurs' offer, and it's important to remember Eze himself is an Arsenal supporter.\n\"His wish was very important in this - Arsenal matched Spurs' bid of £60m, including £7.5m in add-ons. Remember, he had a release clause which expired last week, which was worth up to £68m.\n\"Arsenal have been interested in signing him all summer and their fans were crying out for them to make a move for him.\n\"When you looked at how much business they had already done this summer you could suggest they had to sell before they brought in another player.\n\"Is this move motivated by the fact Kai Havertz picked up this injury at Old Trafford? Or have they been really smart and avoided getting involved in a bidding war, and knew he would choose Arsenal if he had a choice, and waited for Spurs to agree a deal before they turn up at the 11th hour and matched it. I think it's a bit of both.\n\"I have some sympathy for Spurs. This is not football manager, this is real life. I don't want to kick Spurs when they're down - I'm trying to see it from the perspective of their hierarchy.\n\"I think they did everything they could to try to sell the club to Eze. A lot of Spurs fans are asking why they didn't trigger his release clause before Friday, but maybe they tried to do that and the player could've dragged his feet. Maybe he was keeping his options open.\n\"Spurs fans are very angry and criticising Daniel Levy and the owners, but I think we should keep things in perspective; these kind of things happen all the time in the window.\n\"Ultimately, everyone knows Eze is an Arsenal fan, as are his whole family. He played for them until he was 13 when he was released.\n\"Why didn't Spurs trigger the release clause? It might've needed paying in one lump sum. They might've waited until it expired to get a better deal.\"\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports .",

Starting from the ownership, starting from Josh [Kroenke] and then all the board to recognise that we had to act.\n\"It was our choice, obviously. That shows the level of determination and how much we want to take this club to a different level.\"\nEze was one of a number of players Arsenal looked into in the first few weeks of the window, where, significantly, a lot of the work was carried out in June when they explored the conditions of a deal.

It was very, very important. I'm delighted to have him. You can tell how much it means to him and his whole family.\n\"Welcome to our family and I'm sure we're going to have some great moments together.\"\nAsked about what Eze brings to Arsenal, Arteta said: \"The talent is unquestionable. He's done it in this league. The personality, unbelievable.\n\"He has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations.\n\"He's got that flair. He's got that charisma as well about him that is very contagious.\"\nArsenal have held a long-standing interest in Eze, who was previously on the books of their academy and has said he was a supporter of the club growing up.

        "title": "Tottenham's perfect Premier League start continues and they have Thomas Frank to thank",
        "content": "For the second straight year Tottenham triumphed at the Etihad, beating Manchester City 2-0 with a composed and clinical performance to end City's 10-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League.\nSpurs are only the second side to win away to a Pep Guardiola-managed team in back-to-back seasons. And this one was far too easily achieved.\nCity fans will have left the Etihad on Saturday with more questions than answers after a performance that was the complete antithesis of last weekend's win over Wolves.\nCreative, fluid patterns that led to goal-scoring opportunities were replaced by unimaginative, misplaced passes, that resulted in very little positive. City underwhelmed for the majority, but you have to wonder how much of that underperformance was down to Spurs' organised and aggressive gameplan.\nFrom the first time James Trafford was offered the ball in open play, it was evident that Thomas Frank had directed his players to rush the City box. Richarlison nearly nicked the ball off his toe in the ninth minute of the game. They swarmed in packs and never let City settle, eventually forcing the mistake for Joao Palhinha to score a well-timed second goal. City had no response.\nThe visitors were content conceding possession, but hit City where it hurt, with more efforts at goal and a greater number of shots on target. Each of the two big chances they created ended in a goal. The two Man City generated ended in a miss.\nCity were being confronted by a team who looked more confident and assured in their specific roles, like they had played this way for years. Like it came naturally.\nCristian Romero did a number on Erling Haaland. Palhinha, who won more duels than any other player, and Rodrigo Bentancur were more assertive than Tijjani Reijnders and Nico Gonzalez in midfield. Mohammed Kudus more direct in attack.\n\"I have a feeling the performance was a little bit better than the result,\" reflected Guardiola, generously. His reading of the game will be incompatible with most others.\nSaturday's result was not only a statement victory for the Frank regime, but a triumph of managerial style.\nHaving also won with Brentford in November 2022, Frank becomes only the third manager to beat Guardiola away from home with two different clubs. There's no coincidence in that. \"I definitely believe in the aggressive press, as you saw today, and as you saw with my Brentford team,\" Frank told reporters at the Etihad.\n\"I believe in being front-footed. I like that mentality, it's a more offensive way of defending. It's more fun to defend on the opponents' half. So, yeah, let's go for it.\"\nSpurs may have started the campaign under the highly Spursy contradiction of having endured their worst domestic season for nearly 50 years, while simultaneously landing a first trophy since 2008, but Frank is out to change perceptions for good.\n\"We have been working so hard on our defensive principles. Mentality is the key thing - you need mentality to win games like this,\" he added.\nTottenham have long been mocked for an absence of big-game mindset. The term Spursy is rooted in that all-too-familiar shortcoming, evident just three weeks ago in Super Cup defeat to PSG after blowing a 2-0 lead.\nBut they have passed the real acid test with flying colours in these opening two weeks, with Frank's fingerprint also all over the 3-0 downing of Burnley.\n\nEven failed pursuits to sign a No 10 - losing out on Eberechi Eze to Arsenal just this week - have not derailed focus. Spurs' creative side has shone, scoring five times, while registering two clean sheets.\nSix points and a goal difference of +5 represents their best start to a league season. A small sample size, yes, but a big change in identity and fortitude. The question now will be: how long can it last?",

        "content": "Arsenal's injury concerns deepened further on Saturday Night Football as Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard were taken off against Leeds.\nGunners captain Odegaard went down under a challenge in the first half and suffered a shoulder injury, coming off having initially played on.\nArsenal's woes worsened in the second half when Saka - who had scored Arsenal's second goal on the stroke of half-time - went down with an issue in his left hamstring.\nThe England international missed four months of last season with a serious hamstring injury, and was replaced by Leandro Trossard in the 53rd minute.\n\"Martin felt something in his shoulder when he landed,\" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, who added the captain would have a scan on Sunday.\n\"Bukayo, carrying the ball, felt something in his hamstring. I think it's the other one, not the same as the previous injury.\n\"He felt something sprinting, that's never a good sign. We have to speak to the doctors [on Sunday]. Let's wait.\"\nReacting to Saka's injury, Gary Neville said on co-commentary on Sky Sports : \"You can read his lips. He said: 'Oh my God'. This is something he doesn't like. He's a tough kid. He doesn't go down injured easily, if ever.\"\n\nAnd Sky Sports' Nick Wright added: \"Saka looks worried as he goes off. So do the Arsenal fans around us. There are a few words in the ear of Arteta and his assistant, then it's down the tunnel, shaking his head as he goes.\"\nOnce again, the injury issues for Arsenal are piling up ahead of an early season showdown with Liverpool next weekend, live on Super Sunday.\nKai Havertz had already been ruled out ahead of the game against Leeds, although the extent of his injury has not yet been revealed.\n\"In two weeks, already we lost Kai [Havertz], Bukayo, Martin,\" said Arteta. \"It shows how well equipped you have to be in this league.\"\n\nSummer signing Christian Norgaard is also yet to make his debut as he continues to recover from an injury, while Ben White did not pass a late fitness test for Saturday's game.\nJurrien Timber's minutes are continuing to be managed - although he scored twice and assisted against Leeds - while Gabriel Jesus continues his recovery from an ACL injury.\nThe injury concerns come after a jubilant pre-match introduction of Eberechi Eze , who was introduced to the home crowd wearing the No 10 shirt after signing from Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nSky Sports' Jamie Redknapp:\n\"They need Eze. He may start at Anfield. I would like to see him play centrally. It could be difficult for him to play wide. Right now the player under a little bit of pressure is Martin Odegaard. He'll be looking at Eze thinking he could be a problem for me. If you asked Eze, he'd want to play centrally.\n\"There are lots of players that can come in but there's only one Bukayo Saka. When he had surgery on his other hamstring, it deflated the whole team - they weren't the same and lost a goal threat.\n\"He was their talisman. Saka is the one that when he gets the ball everything will be alright. To not have him at Anfield will be a major blow.\"\n\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta on new signing Eberechi Eze:\n\"The talent is unquestionable. He's done it in this league. The personality, unbelievable.\n\"He has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations.\n\"He's got that flair. He's got that charisma as well about him that is very contagious.\"",

        "title": "Alexander Isak: Newcastle striker wants to leave amid Liverpool interest - but what happens now?",
        "content": "Liverpool would have hoped to have Alexander Isak lining up for them against Newcastle on Monday Night Football this evening - but the Swedish forward remains in a transfer stand-off with the Magpies with a week to go until Deadline Day.\nIsak put out an explosive statement last Tuesday regarding the ongoing saga, saying his Newcastle career \"cannot continue\" following \"broken promises\" made by the club.\nThis is after Liverpool saw a £110m bid rejected by Newcastle earlier this summer.\n\nIsak has not yet featured for Eddie Howe's side in matches since Newcastle returned to pre-season duty. He has been spotted at the club's training ground but has trained away from the first team, who have started the new Premier League season in his absence.\nSo have Isak's latest comments put the Liverpool move back on? If a deal does not happen, is there any way back for Isak at Newcastle this season? And crucially, how big a few weeks is this in the context of the Premier League title?\nSky Sports answers all the key questions below - as we all start deliberating: what is next?\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nThere is a blurring of the lines about this. In his statement, Isak's section was somewhat ambiguous regarding the \"broken promises\" that have been reneged on. Newcastle clarified in their own statement they have not communicated any promise to Isak about him leaving the club.\nHowever, it is our understanding that Isak's claims of broken promises relate to a contract renewal that was discussed with the club. He claims he was promised a new deal which he has wanted for the last 18 months - and that hasn't materialised.\nIsak feels he wants a contract - with higher wages - that reflects his status as one of the top Premier League strikers.\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nNewcastle have been angered by what Isak said on his social media - and have dug their heels in.\nNewcastle are in a strong position, which is what they were saying in their club statement. Isak has three years left on that existing six-year contract that he signed. And they remain very calm on the situation despite the outside noise.\nThis is a situation where Newcastle have tried this summer to try and find a replacement, to allow Isak to then leave.\nThey tried to sign Hugo Ekitike, who would have been a like-for-like replacement. They tried to sign Benjamin Sesko, who would have been a like-for-like replacement. And they've got right down to the nitty-gritty in both those deals and lost out, ironically, to Liverpool and then to Manchester United respectively.\n\nNeither of these players were being bought to play alongside Isak, they were bought to facilitate Isak's move away. And either of those deals would have allowed Isak to join Liverpool - but the failure to get Ekitike or Sesko has left Newcastle in a difficult situation.\nNewcastle feel that they have scoured the market but there is now a private resignation that there is no one else left for them to pursue as a top target.\nRight now, Newcastle need Isak. And it feels very much like in this current climate, Isak will remain a Newcastle player beyond the end of the transfer window.\nWhat will be really interesting will be if and when Isak returns to the pitch wearing black and white stripes. Newcastle fans called him a \"greedy b******\" from the stands during last weekend's 0-0 draw against Aston Villa - a match which showcased how much Newcastle need him.\n\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett:\nFrom a legal standpoint, there is very little Alexander Isak can do to get out of his Newcastle contract.\nReports have suggested the striker had a verbal agreement with the club to leave this summer.\nNewcastle denied that any such commitment was made to the player in their statement responding to Isak's post on Instagram.\nLegally, such an arrangement - if it did exist - is irrelevant to a player's contract and in no way binding under Premier League rules.\nThere are only two scenarios in which a player can annul their contract - when they haven't been paid or the club has breached the terms of the contract - and neither seem to be valid in Isak's case.\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nNewcastle spoke in their statement about the conditions of a sale. There were two conditions.\nOne, Newcastle's valuation of the player.\nThat valuation is £150m. But they would probably do a deal for a little bit less than that, though Liverpool's £110m offer that landed a few weeks ago is way short. So if Liverpool were to really seriously want Isak, they would have to come to the table with a higher bid.\nThe second is that Newcastle need to find a replacement .\nThey've been trying to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford. But he's seen as the Callum Wilson replacement rather than the Isak replacement. So they're actually even struggling to bring in a replacement for Wilson, who left on a free contract and has joined West Ham.\nSo Isak would be allowed to go if:\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie:\nIf Newcastle sign two strikers between now and the end of the window - and that's unlikely in the time left, which Newcastle alluded to in their statement - then Isak is likely to go.\nBut if they get one striker, such as Wissa, who they have made a new bid for, and Liverpool make an eye-watering offer for Isak - of around £130m to £135m - then Newcastle might have a big decision to make.\nThere is an outside chance of Isak's departure happening in those circumstances. But it would leave Newcastle very light on striker reinforcements.\nNewcastle had a bid of £35m, plus add-ons, rejected by Brentford last Wednesday.\nIt's going to be a very tense last week, it feels like a line in the sand was drawn from both parties last night, and Newcastle's stance on the issue has hardened on the back of Isak's statements. There is a feeling that Isak has done himself no favours by making that statement.\n\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nThere is a stalemate in this saga: a player who does not want to play anymore and a club that does not want to sell him. Both are trying to achieve their aims at any cost.\nThere have been plenty of incidents in the past where players have dug their heels in, refused to train in the hope of getting a move. See Dimitar Berbatov , who missed the start of Spurs' season in 2008/09 to get a move to Manchester United.\nThere was even one earlier this summer in the form of Viktor Gyokeres , who did not turn up to the start of Sporting CP's pre-season training.\n\nNoises emerged of a broken agreement about his value between the player and the club - with Gyokeres winning that battle by getting a £63.5m move to Arsenal.\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nThere have been some high-profile instances where the club have stayed resilient and won in the face of player power. In 2021, Harry Kane expressed his desire to leave Tottenham and did not even show up for the first day of pre-season training, for which he was fined.\nLike Isak's situation, City had put in a £100m bid for Kane - who also had three years left on his contract.\nAnd while Spurs looked for centre forward replacements in the window, they stood firm and ended up keeping Kane after bids kept on being rejected. The England captain would end up leaving two years later for that same £100m fee to Bayern Munich.\nThere was another incident where the club won out in Carlos Tevez at Manchester City. In September 2011, the Argentine refused to come off the bench against Bayern Munich and manager Roberto Mancini insisted Tevez was \"finished\" at the club.\nAfter refusing to apologise and receiving multiple fines from City over breaches of contract, Tevez returned to Argentina without permission from the club. Months went by without a resolution but City rejected approaches from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain for Tevez in the January transfer window.\nTwo weeks after the transfer deadline, Tevez returned to City and then apologised for his conduct. He was back in Mancini's team by March and then helped them to a first Premier League title that season.\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\nThere is a growing feeling among the wider public that Isak's behaviour is unacceptable and this could even impact fan sentiment on Merseyside.\nHowever, speaking to Sky Sports News last week, Jamie Carragher felt Isak's tactics would be unlikely to lead to Liverpool's interest being affected.\n\"They won't, whether we think they should or shouldn't,\" he said, before making it clear he didn't agree with the approach.\n\"I don't think when you have a club paying your wages and supporters paying to watch you play you should refuse to play or train. I don't think that's acceptable.\"\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\nLiverpool have already been busy in the transfer market this summer, making significant changes in the forward positions. The acquisitions of Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz have encouraged supporters but there have also been some high-profile departures.\nDarwin Nunez and Luis Diaz have been sold, while, of course, Diogo Jota tragically passed away at the start of July. In a recent interview with Sky Sports, Arne Slot argued that Liverpool were still short up front. \"We need to have one more attacker,\" he said.\n\nIsak's firepower would be an asset for any team and Liverpool believe that he could be a difference maker. They won the Premier League title by 10 points having scored 17 more goals than second-placed Arsenal but Slot's view is that the margins were small.\n\"Although we have created the most chances in the league, scored the most goals in the league, we have mostly won games by one goal difference.\" In fact, nine of Liverpool's 25 Premier League victories last season came by just one goal.\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\nLiverpool have already committed £79m to bringing in Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt and the France international forward has made a promising start to life at Anfield with goals in his first two games for the club. Many would argue that he warrants a run.\nSlot himself has acknowledged that Ekitike's best position is up front but he also pointed out that there are other ways that the flexible forward can fit in. \"I see Hugo mainly as a No 9 who could also play from the left or with another No 9,\" told Sky Sports .\nWatch Newcastle vs Liverpool live on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football next week from 6.30pm, kick-off 8pm",

        "title": "Nuno Espirito Santo: Nottingham Forest boss reveals he wants to remain in charge with talks to be held",
        "content": "Nuno Espirito Santo insists he wants to stay in charge of Nottingham Forest and has revealed he will hold talks with owner Evangelos Marinakis and transfer chief Edu Gaspar to resolve his future.\n\nOn Friday, Nuno poured fuel on speculation that his job was under threat, saying “where there’s smoke, there’s fire”.\n\nIn a remarkable press conference, he also said his relationship with Marinakis was \"not the same\" and \"it is not so good as it was [last season]\", causing some within the club to seriously question the 51-year-old's commitment to the job.\n\n\nBut ahead of Sunday's match at Crystal Palace, Nuno said he is committed to Forest and believes talks with the club's hierarchy will put an end to the unrest around his job.\nAsked by Sky Sports in his pre-match interview at Selhurst Park over whether he was trying to engineer an exit from Forest, he replied: \"That's nonsense, that doesn't make any kind of sense.\n\"The state is that we are focused on the game, that's more important.\"\nQuestioned if he wants to continue as Forest head coach, he said: \"Of course! Of course!\"\nAsked whether he would hold face-to-face talks with Marinakis and Edu, he responded: \"Yes. That's what we need to do, and we're going to do it.\n\"Not today, of course, because it's the match, but soon, of course.\nThe Portuguese added: \"There's no speculation around anything. What we have is to communicate - how we're going to approach the final days of the market, how we're going to approach the new season, how we're going to prepare our boys.\"\nNuno doubled down on his pre-match comments when asked after his side rescued a 1-1 draw at Palace.\n\"This narrative is absurd,\" Nuno said.\n\"I wouldn't ever walk away. I don't know how many years I have of coaching, and many of you guys have known me for many years. Now I came to Wolves and the Championship. I love what I do. The moment that I don't enjoy it, it's over.\"\nHowever, when asked whether he believes he'd be Forest boss come the end of the transfer window, Nuno could not provide any assurances over his future.\n\"I cannot answer that question, but what I know is that I'm working and trying to do my job the best that I can.\n\"Of course, the situation has to be solved, and we are responsible persons, we're going to have a good conversation to try to create more than anything, a good platform for what is more important, the team.\"\n\nNuno also insisted his relationship with Marinakis can be repaired, having described it as \"not the same\" earlier in the week.\n\"Everybody wants the best for Forest. Me first, and the president first, and all the club wants the best for Forest.\n\"I think it's the first time that I'm facing the situation and being asked these things; it's not helpful. But I believe work with conflict doesn't work out. We have to create harmony. We need it.\n\"They [Forest hierarchy] were here today. We showed Forest is. For us, in these days, since the press conference, what is really important.\n\"The players, the fans, they were here supporting the team. The players show character and ambition, and commitment. We played a good game. We have a good platform to move forward.\"\n\n\nSky Sports News has been told Marinakis and the Nottingham Forest bosses are baffled by Nuno's latest comments, and there has been no intention of sacking him as the club's manager.\nSky Sports News also understands discussions are happening behind the scenes, and it is a fast-moving situation.\nRegardless of Marinakis' obvious anger, he was keen to try to bring some kind of unity to the fore ahead of the visit to Palace.\nMarinakis does not want further distractions for the squad, which he, and many others, feel is the strongest Forest have had for decades.\nIt is also thought to be unlikely that Nuno will resign without the prospect of a payoff.\n\nNuno's comments, which sparked the current unrest behind the scenes at the City Ground, came a week after he said in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports ahead of the opening game that his squad was \"unbalanced\" and \"very, very far\" from being ready for the new season.\nSince Nuno said that, Marinakis has sanctioned over £118m worth of spending on four new players in the last week. That level of spending, the Greek billionaire feels, is proof that Nuno still had his full confidence and backing.\nThe root of Nuno's upset is not wholly understood; however, it's thought he has a difficult relationship with Forest's new global head of football, Edu, who was appointed last month to oversee the recruitment strategy for Forest and the other clubs in Marinakis' multi-club empire - Olympiakos in Greece and Rio Ave in Portugal.\nNevertheless, despite Edu's arrival, the club structure at the City Ground and Nuno's role have not changed.\nSince Nuno took over in December 2023, while he has had a say in transfer strategy and the players being targeted, his role has been to galvanise and organise that group of players as the head coach in charge of the first team.\n\n\n",

        "title": "Manchester United attack still a work in progress after draw at Fulham as Jack Grealish shines - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\n\"We are going to score goals because we are creating so many chances.\"\nRuben Amorim is convinced Manchester United's attack will fire this season. The evidence suggests it will. They threatened to run riot in the opening 15 minutes at Fulham, but a concern is how they've faded in games.\nMatheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes were purring early on at Craven Cottage. Cunha went close three times. The quartet linked up with speed and precision around the box. They looked sharp.\nBut it didn't last once Fulham settled and stifled Casemiro and Fernandes with their midfield diamond. Ruben Amorim's substitutions also weren't able to have the same impact as Fulham's, Emile Smith Rowe equalising with his first touch.\nBenjamin Sesko came off the bench early in the second half but had just one touch in the opposition box - it wasn't a telling one.\nLast weekend, United's possession was in the spotlight, racking up 60 per cent against a traditional top-four side for the first time in almost a decade. It helped them get the ball into dangerous areas and fire off 22 shots.\nThis time it was different, over 10 per cent less as they were out-passed by Fulham, not by much, but with only 10 shots to show from it. Amorim's side remain a work in progess. David Richardson\n\nJack Grealish received the biggest cheer even before Everton kicked off against Brighton in the first Premier League game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium but the cheers were bigger in the 93rd minute as he left the field after a player-of-the-match performance.\nThe winger picked up two assists in Everton's 2-0 win - as many as in the previous two seasons combined at Manchester City. Had Dwight McNeil converted a late chance, it would have been a hat-trick of assists for the first time since his Aston Villa days.\n\"I hope he has got more of them to come,\" said David Moyes afterwards, acknowledging that Grealish gives this Everton something different. \"The big thing is he ball-carried for us. He retained the ball for us as well which gave us a little bit more composure.\"\nIt is no great surprise that Grealish showed good technique. The only question was how he would approach this challenge after the disappointment of finding himself surplus to requirements at City. But he showed that he had the stomach for the fight too.\nHe was tracking back inside two minutes. Putting in a tackle inside his own box just after the hour. \"He was game for it, didn't try to shirk anything, didn't want off after 60 minutes, didn't want any of that,\" said Moyes. \"No chance, he wants to show that he's the real deal.\n\"You know, you admire somebody who's saying, he probably has something to prove. I had something to prove, I think, over the years at different times. Sometimes it gives you that challenge that you have to try and be ready to take. Hopefully, Jack is.\" Adam Bate\n\nAnthony Elanga, who? Dan Ndoye is beginning to impress, filling the hole left by the Swede. With two games, he's already registered two goal contributions. After a debut goal against Brentford and an assist against Palace, he became the first Nottingham Forest player to score or assist in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since 1998.\nElanga's attributes were clear and Ndoye perhaps doesn't possess the blistering speed that Newcastle's summer signing has.\nHowever, Ndoye's adaptability will impress Nuno, who can continue to hope for an interchanging and dynamic forward line.\nNdoye's first-half display saw him marshalled out of the game. However, all it took was a tweak from Nuno to switch him and Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ndoye's individual brilliance did the rest to carve out the assist that earned Forest a point.\nNuno wants more in the door in terms of transfers but at present Ndoye for £34m looks like a masterstroke. William Bitibiri\nWithin the whirlwind that Crystal Palace have caught themselves up in this summer, it's been too easy to forget the fine work that is still being accomplished at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace continued an unbeaten start to the season.\nWhether it's the demotion to the Conference League or Palace's biggest stars being linked and in Eberechi Eze's case, securing a move away, the Eagles have navigated a strong start to the season. Their four games unbeaten are reflective of the mentality Glasner has developed in SE25.\nA win in the Community Shield saw Palace fight back to take Premier League Champions Liverpool to penalties. Their opening league fixture at Chelsea saw them controversially denied a point at the home of the world champions.\nA first game in Europe followed with Eze's future an acceptable distraction but still Palace secured victory. Against Forest, Palace will feel they dropped two points against a side that scored with their only shot on target. But Oliver Glasner will see the positives in their display.\nTheir start is a total contrast to the beginnings of last campaign, where a slow start brought Glasner into question. Their recent run represents a growing consistency that is going under the radar. William Bitibiri\nTo not score a goal from an expected goals figure of 2.46 was quite an achievement by Brighton.\nNot since Manchester City created 2.92 at Crystal Palace in March 2022 had a team in the Premier League created such a high xG figure without scoring away from home.\nPerhaps the footballing gods were working their magic for Everton on their big day so Brighton didn't really stand a chance but Fabian Hurzeler will be worried about the flakiness of his forwards.\nDanny Welbeck was responsible for 1.54 of that expected goals figure, missing from almost under the crossbar with the goal gaping and also from the penalty spot.\nHurzeler will be hoping it was just one of those days at the office rather than anything too deep-rooted. Lewis Jones\nMarco Silva deserves a lot of credit for how his Fulham side have battled to start the Premier League season.\nTwo games with two late goals to rescue a point on both occasions, they could have easily walked away empty-handed.\nSilva has been vocal about the need for reinforcements within his squad, with Benjamin Lecomte their only addition throughout the summer, and spoke openly about it after full-time against Manchester United, too.\n\"We need to sign two or three players,\" he said in his post-match press conference. \"We have eight or nine days to correct some things.\n\"We have a lot of games and have injuries; in some positions, we are short.\"\nReturns for Antonee Robinson and Ryan Sessegnon, as well as a boost in confidence for Emile Smith Rowe following his goal, will ease the strain on his squad.\nHowever, if they want to start converting draws into wins, fresh faces will be needed.\nThey had the momentum to win this fixture but just lacked the final push in the latter stages of the game.

        "title": "Russell Martin: Rangers boss reveals Hamza Igamane sub frustration and questions commitment of players",
        "content": "Russell Martin questioned the commitment of some of his Rangers players after revealing he couldn't bring on Hamza Igamane during the 1-1 draw with St Mirren because the forward told him he was injured.\nIgamane was named on the bench for the trip to Paisley but didn't make an appearance, despite the fact the visitors looked short of ideas in attack for much of the game.\nEighteen-year-old Findlay Curtis would end up coming on and scored shortly after to salvage a point for Rangers, who are without a win in their first three league games of the season for the first time since 1989.\n\nHowever, Martin couldn't hide his frustration over the situation after the final whistle and told Sky Sports he felt some of his players had one foot out the door.\n\"Hamza told me he was injured,\" explained the Rangers boss.\n\n\"We had a bid this week for Hamza, we rejected it. All was fine. Trained fine yesterday [Saturday], warmed up fine. I turned around to him at 60 minutes because I wanted two strikers on the pitch. Hamza told me he was injured.\n\"I don't know [if he refused to play.] I have to trust him but we'll see. The issue is that the transfer window is still open. There are a lot of people, one eye out the door and one in and we need people to be all in all the time in this football club.\n\"We really need that. At the minute there's still too many people uncertain or still trying to think, 'maybe there's something there for me'. The window needs to shut quickly.\n\"In-house we need to make sure that we have people who really want to be here, so the people that come in and the people that stay really want to be here. We'll see.\n\"I think there's a few areas we're looking to strengthen. I don't think anything's imminent being really honest. We've spoken to a few people. I know it's a boring answer but it's me being honest with you. I don't know what the Hamza situation will be after today.\"\n\nSky Sports Kris Boyd :\n\"I think I said it a couple of weeks ago, I think the players have been running the club for far too long. Listen, if he's injured, he's injured. I highly doubt it.\n\"If that is the case, if I'm Rangers Football Club I'd drive him to the airport and say goodbye. If you've not got people who are willing to knuckle down and help this team at this moment of time, then see you later.\n\"If you don't there's a real danger. It's at boiling point right now with the fans. If Russell Martin is not strong, and doesn't see this through, he's going to join Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Michael Beale, Philippe Clement out the door.\n\"He needs to get the right type of characters in this dressing room and quick. I do question if Martin is a little too honest. After a game, emotions are still high and if you've turned to your bench for a striker that the fans think is the blue-eyed boy; I've not seen what everybody thinks.\n\"On a consistent basis, Hamza Igamane hasn't done what everyone thinks he's done for Rangers. He's another one who is inflated and everybody thinks is better than he is.\"\nBefore the game, Martin demanded more energy from his players than what was on display in midweek against Club Brugge in the Champions League. And long before he turned to Igamane to potentially make an impact off the bench, they were off the pace.\nMartin admitted post-match that his players struggled to deal with setbacks during games and was critical of their immediate response to going behind. However, attention was quickly shifted to Igamane's injury, which led Chris Sutton to ask whether Martin was deflecting from another poor performance.\nAfter the draw against Motherwell on the opening day of the Scottish Premiership season, Martin warned his squad that there would be people \"left behind\" if they didn't want to be part of turning the club's fortunes around.\nMuch of that rhetoric was on display again from the ex-Southampton boss, as he continued to question the attitude and dedication of his playing staff. The reality, though, is that after nine games in charge, he has created history - the wrong kind of history - becoming the first permanent manager in the club's history to win just three times over that period.\nWhile question marks will no doubt fall on Martin, with season-defining games on the horizon, the Rangers boss may need to change his tune or further risk losing the dressing room and the Ibrox faithful.",

        "title": "Fulham 1-1 Man Utd: Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva fume over Rodrigo Muniz own goal after ‘clear foul’ by Leny Yoro",
        "content": "Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva both felt Manchester United's opener at Fulham should have been ruled out for a clear push by Leny Yoro in the build-up - on an afternoon of officiating controversy at Craven Cottage.\nIn the pulsating 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage, Yoro appeared to have two hands in the back of Fulham defender Bassey as he met a United corner, before forcing a Rodrigo Muniz own goal. VAR Darren England approved the goal after a brief check.\nBut Bassey felt referee Chris Kavanagh \"will be disappointed\" when they look back at the decision - especially as the Fulham defender was penalised for a shove on Mason Mount in the first half which gave United a penalty - that Bruno Fernandes missed.\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the game, Bassey said on the Yoro incident: \"It's a foul. He pushed me to stop me from getting to the ball. When the ref looks back on it, he will be disappointed. I can't say too much before I get a fine!\n\n\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He [Yoro] has got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.\n\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports about the Yoro incident, Fulham boss Silva added: \"The way the goal came and all that stuff, it's a clear foul. The boys reacted very, very well.\n\n\"I cannot understand it. I would love to explain everything to you from the first whistle to the last. But I don't have this. It's not my job, I don't want to go in this direction for everything that went on this afternoon at Craven Cottage.\"\nAnalysing the United goal on co-commentary duty, Gary Neville said: \"If I was Fulham, I would be asking about the two hands in Bassey's back.\n\"Both hands on the back and Yoro is lucky to get away with that, but he will not care.\"\nSky Sports News has approached the PGMOL for comment.\n\nBassey was also at the centre of VAR controversy as he was accused by the officials of bringing down Mount in the penalty area.\nAs per PGMOL guidance, referees will award more penalties for holding this season - in an attempt to crack down on grappling at set-pieces.\n\nReferee Kavanagh did not award the shove on Mount in real time but - two minutes after the incident, the official was sent to the VAR monitor during the next available break in play.\n\"I still think it's harsh,\" said Bassey about the incident. \"I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.\n\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.\n\"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be won, sometimes you're trying to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.\n\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.\n\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"\nAsked if he was relieved at Fernandes then missing the penalty, Bassey replied: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"\n\nThere was even controversy as Fernandes stepped up to take the spot-kick, with the United captain colliding with referee Kavanagh in the build-up.\nAnalysing the incident on co-commentary duty, Neville said: \"He picked the ball up, and maybe the referee has given him a bump by accident. And he goes back, it unnerved him a little bit.\n\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but [a few seconds later] he was still having a go at the referee, Fernandes - as he feels it was a little bit clumsy. That is maybe what put him off.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the game, Fernandes said: \"I was upset. As a penalty-taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do.\n\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.\n\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"\nAsked for his take on the incident, United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"I think he's not used to missing a penalty. He knows that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team.\n\"I felt that during the game he was not so happy, not so involved, because he had so much responsibility and he felt the missed penalty was huge for us.\"\nWatch Dermot Gallagher analyse the incidents in Fulham 1-1 Man Utd as well as all the other refereeing points from the Premier League weekend on Sky Sports News at 9am on Monday morning",

        "content": "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.\nEmile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.\nThe opening-weekend performance at Old Trafford offered encouragement as new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo impressed, but Sky Sports pundit Neville felt Sunday's game highlighted familiar problems - particularly in midfield.\nRuben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.\n\n\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast .\n\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.\n\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.\n\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.\n\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.\n\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.\n\n\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.\n\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"\nFor the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.\nThe Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.\n\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.\n\"Sesko, at the moment, let's just say it, he's nowhere near in terms of fitness or just getting up to speed.\"\nNeville feels the striker will need to be given more minutes to build his fitness, starting in Wednesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie away to Grimbsy Town.\n\"Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him,\" said Neville. \"Last week, I was saying, 'look, let's just get him straight in'.\n\"He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.\n\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football.\n\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.\n\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"\nNeville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.\nThe skipper blasted his effort over the bar after referee Chris Kavanagh had bumped into him as he prepared to take it, with Fernandes later telling Sky Sports he was \"upset\" not to receive an apology from the official.\n\"I think he let it impact him,\" said Neville. \"I thought he let it get to him. When he came out for the second half, he was still talking to the referee.\n\n\"I know that can happen, but I think you can see in his face sometimes with Bruno that he wears his heart on his sleeve and it was quite clear that obviously he's desperately disappointed about missing the penalty in the way in which he did.\n\"Sometimes, if a goalkeeper saves it you might think, 'OK, that happened', but he's smashed it over the bar, and then there was this idea that the referee disrupted his rhythm.\n\"It was a complete accident. Obviously the referee was trying to walk back towards the players coming in.\n\"He just seemed to let it impact him in the game and I think that's just something that shouldn't have happened really, but that wasn't the biggest problem out there for United today.\"",

        "title": "Viktor Gyokeres' runs for Arsenal, James Garner's flexibility and Adrien Truffert's overlapping runs feature in The Debrief",
        "content": "Welcome to The Debrief , a Sky Sports column in which Adam Bate uses a blend of data and opinion to reflect on some of the key stories from the latest Premier League matches. This week:\nThe whispers about Viktor Gyokeres had already begun by the time he cut inside to score for Arsenal on his Premier League home debut. An hour at Manchester United followed by 45 minutes without a goal against Leeds was enough for pressure to build.\nBut after adding a stoppage-time penalty, the record reads two goals from two games. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had called it. \"I think we are going to be extremely happy when he starts to put the ball in the back of the net very, very often which is his biggest ability.\"\nEveryone had argued Arsenal needed a natural goalscorer. Finding a way to incorporate him without losing what makes Arteta's side so good was always going to be the challenge. Even at this early stage of the season, there are signs it could be a delicate balancing act.\nGyokeres is different to Arsenal's other options. The statistics highlight that clearly. The Sweden international has made 27 runs challenging the backline so far this Premier League season - the most by any player in the competition. One brought his first goal.\nRiccardo Calafiori's first-time pass behind Leeds' high defensive line gave Gyokeres something to chase. \"It is almost his signature move,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports . \"He wants to run the other way.\" But Arsenal players are not so used to seeking out this movement.\nAlthough Gabriel Martinelli makes that run from out to in, it is more usual for Kai Havertz to come towards the ball. Arsenal need to get used to looking for that pass. \"I think we need to make an effort as well to try to understand him, to connect,\" admitted Arteta.\nThe stats also show that the majority of those Gyokeres runs did not result in a pass being sent his way. And even when the striker has received the ball, he has been among the most isolated players in the Premier League so far. That connection must improve.\nArteta appears aware of the issue and one would expect a better understanding with his new team-mates to emerge in time. \"We have done a lot of work this week in relation to that as well. I am sure he is going to be fine. He is a very smart, intuitive player.\"\nPerhaps a little \"scruffy\" - as Gary Neville put it on co-commentary for Sky Sports . But Arsenal have enough class and cuteness elsewhere in their squad. Now they have the hammer as well as the scalpel, cutting through teams should be more straightforward.\n\nOne of football's classic lines came courtesy of Hector Enrique, the Argentina midfielder who stabbed the ball in the direction of Diego Maradona prior to his 'Goal of the Century' against England at the 1986 World Cup. \"With a pass like that, how could he miss?\"\nJames Garner's strike against Brighton was not exactly Maradona dancing through the opposition from inside his own half but, unlike Enrique, much of the credit for this goal has gone to Jack Grealish for rolling the ball into his path. Let's give Garner his flowers too.\nIt was not just that his tremendous strike sealed the 2-0 victory for Everton in the first Premier League game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Garner's goal came in a game in which he was filling in at left-back, given the daunting task of marking Yankuba Minteh.\nPutting that matter to Moyes afterwards, he replied: \"Probably the biggest thing for me is getting a result today when we have got half a botched team out in some ways. We have got players missing who would be in. We are having to play players out of position.\"\nHe added: \"We have been struggling probably since the end of last season, all through the summer and we still are now. So, Jimmy Garner's performance was fabulous because I thought he played well on Monday night as well. I thought he did a great job.\"\nGarner stuck to his task and gave Grealish plenty of support too. No Everton player had more touches than he did, feeding the ball to the England winger and often playing simple passes to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in what looks like a promising combination.\n\nWithout Vitalii Mykolenko, Nathan Patterson and Jarrad Branthwaite, Moyes has had to turn to Garner in yet another different role. His natural position is in midfield but needs must. \"His versatility is so important to us,\" said Moyes.\n\"He has got the ability to score, he always has had, and he got a good goal. It is good because he is really a midfield player so to get his first goal on the board today is great. We want our midfield players to start getting much more goals.\" Even from left-back.\n\nSpeaking of left-backs, Bournemouth have found another one following the sale of Milos Kerkez to Liverpool. Adrien Truffert, the 23-year-old France international signed from Rennes, delivered another strong performance on his home debut against Wolves.\nNeville had already picked out Truffert as his one to watch this season on Monday Night Football after an adventurous display against Liverpool - in a game in which Kerkez was hooked by his new club. He looked a threat going forward in the win over Wolves too.\nTruffert has made 17 overlapping runs already this season, six more than any other player in the Premier League. Remarkably, he has also made the second most underlapping runs. Whenever Bournemouth have the ball out wide, he is going to go. The ideal replacement.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.",

        "title": "Max Dowman joins Bukayo Saka, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly in showing Arsenal's Hale End academy is their biggest asset",
        "content": "The Emirates Stadium crackled with anticipation every time the ball arrived at the feet of Max Dowman. As in Arsenal's pre-season games, his team-mates made a concerted effort to put it there. It is easy to understand why. The 15-year-old is a special talent.\nDowman became the second-youngest player in Premier League history with his introduction against Leeds, a huge achievement in itself. But most remarkable is that, as well as being Arsenal's youngest player, he once again looked their most dangerous.\nLeeds could not contain him. The drop of the shoulder to win Arsenal's late penalty capped a thrilling debut. On a day of theatre, of unveilings, injuries and first goals, it was Dowman, a schoolboy still four months shy of his 16th birthday, who stole the show.\n\"This is what we see every single day in training,\" smiled Mikel Arteta afterwards. It is something else, though, to do it on this stage. \"He is so convinced that he can go at 15 and deliver that, which I never witnessed in my life,\" added the Arsenal manager.\n\nDowman might be Arsenal's most exciting academy product yet. He certainly looks uniquely ready for the step up at his age. But he is just the latest player off the club's production line in recent years.\nHale End continues to deliver.\nIn the closing stages of Saturday's game, Dowman was one of three teenaged academy graduates on the pitch for Arsenal along with Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly, both of whom are already established at senior level, relative veterans at 18.\nBukayo Saka, an inspiration to all three having become a talismanic figure for the club and its youth set-up, had earlier scored the second goal before being forced off injured. In new signing Eberechi Eze, there was another former Hale Ender watching on.\n\nEze is different, of course, in that he had to leave, aged 13, to make it at senior level. But his connected past makes his return all the more intoxicating to the club's supporters. He was greeted on Saturday as a boyhood fan as well as a former academy player.\nIn the matchday programme, Arsenal's co-chair Josh Kroenke had spoken about the importance of tying Lewis-Skelly and Nwaneri to new contracts. \"They know what it means to be Arsenal,\" he said. So does Eze. The club is woven into his DNA too.\n\"It brings joy, it brings emotion,\" said Arteta afterwards. He was referencing Dowman's emergence but the same can be applied to any one of the club's academy products.\n\nTheir instant bond with the club and its supporters is of course only one part of their offering. Saka, Nwaneri, Lewis-Skelly and Dowman, carefully nurtured by Arsenal since childhood, have added immense quality to the squad at no cost in transfer fees.\nAt only 15, Dowman is too young for a valuation. A player cannot command a transfer fee until he has signed his first professional contract after turning 16. All that can wait for him.\nBut it is dizzying to ponder the heights he might reach, and just how much he might bring to a squad already rated as the world's second-most valuable after that of Real Madrid.\nArsenal have assembled a group of players worth £1.14bn for transfer fees totalling £826m. No other Premier League even comes close in terms of squad value generated compared to cost.\nIt is largely thanks to their blossoming academy products.\nSaka is now valued at £129.3m by Transfermarkt , reflecting his status as one of the world's best players. Still only 23, he remains the academy's jewel, his peak years still to come.\nNwaneri and Lewis-Skelly have some way to go to reach Saka's heights but their trajectories, at 18, are not dissimilar. The former is valued at £48m; the latter £39m. The hope is that they will continue to grow and develop, and that Dowman will be next.\nThe players and their families are of course the key drivers in their success. Together, they also reflect the excellent work of academy director Per Mertesacker and the various coaches who oversaw their progress through the age groups at Hale End.\nBut they also require a manager willing to trust them and they have that in Arteta, whose close relationship with Mertesacker has helped ensure alignment between the academy and the senior side, opening a clear pathway into the first-team.\nSince the start of last season, Arsenal have given more minutes to players aged 18 or under than any other Premier League side. Even academy players who have moved on, such as Emile Smith Rowe and Eddie Nketiah, have generated value through their sales.\nUnusually for a first-team manager, Arteta has taken an active role in meetings with players such as Nwaneri and Lewis-Skelly from a young age, long before they joined the senior squad. But it is since their promotions that their progress has really accelerated.\nIt is partly down to the exposure but Arteta's coaching has helped too. Saka was playing at full-back when Arteta arrived at the club but has flourished as a right-sided forward. Lewis-Skelly, previously a central midfielder, has been reinvented as a left-back.\n\nIt remains to be seen where Dowman's long-term future lies. He has so far been used in Saka's role, cutting inside from the right, onto his left foot. But he can also play centrally, either as a No 8 or a No 10.\nThe possibilities are tantalising. He will of course need to be protected given his age. Dowman is still a year away from sitting his GCSEs. But clearly he has a role to play even in the short-term.\nEvents at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday were a reminder that Arsenal's academy is key to their present as well as their future.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Championship talking points: Frank Lampard's Coventry sparkle, Millwall show steel and Middlesbrough stay perfect",
        "content": "\n\nResult: Coventry 7-1 QPR\nCoventry have now scored 12 goals in their first three Championship games. That stat is made even more impressive by the fact their opener was a goalless draw.\nFrank Lampard's side followed up last week's 5-3 win at Derby with a 7-1 shellacking of sorry QPR. Five goals coming in the first half, and any hope of the away side salvaging any dignity ended by a sixth within minutes of the restart.\n\"Probably the first 45 minutes here was the best we've played since I've been here,\" said Lampard. It had every facet of our game that we talk about, that we work on, everything on the mentality side of it, how at it we were - you could feel the energy on the pitch.\n\"I'm pleased because we as staff have spoken to the players a lot in these opening weeks about what we demand, the standards we want to bring every week consistently, and today we showed it.\"\nThe CBS Arena was, understandably, in a boisterous mood. Fit for a party after the club had announced earlier in the day that they had completed the purchase of their stadium - meaning that they finally own their home for the first time since it was built 20 years ago.\nLampard might be slightly concerned that Jack Rudoni, attracting interest, may be drawing slightly too much attention as Deadline Day looms. If he can keep his squad together then Coventry might well possess the most fearsome attacking line in the Championship. Times are good for the Sky Blues. Simeon Gholam\n\nResult: Charlton 0-1 Leicester\nLeicester's display at Charlton was suggestive of a difficult near-future if the Foxes fail to adequately replace Bilal El Khannouss. The forward was absent from the squad amid intense rumours of a move to Crystal Palace.\nFrom the player's perspective, it would be a deserved return to the Premier League for a player who shone in a dimly-performing Leicester team last term.\nHowever, for the club they lose a creative spark - evident in their at-times laboured approach against Charlton. Marti Cifuentes' side expectedly dominated the ball but, for all their possession, they looked predictable in the final third until Abdul Fatawu's stunning winner.\nBefore then, Fatawu - and Jeremy Monga on the other flank - had struggled to get into the game. But his individual brilliance proved the importance of ensuring he remains at the King Power Stadium past Deadline Day.\n\"It was a fantastic goal which summarises really well what Abdul means to us,\" said Marti Cifuentes afterwards.\n\"If I had to trust all the rumours and speculation then (head of media relations) Jonny (Lally), you have to start next weekend. There is speculation around most of our players.\n\"The target is that we arrive on September 1 in a good position with a team that we want to have. There are some key players that we want to keep and Abdul is one of them.\"\nPrior to the game, Cifuentes spoke of a need for reinforcements as the window draws to a close - that need did not change despite bouncing back from a loss at Preston to win in the Championship. Will Bitibiri\n\nResult: Sheff Utd 0-1 Millwall\nThere were five Millwall first-teamers out injured at Bramall Lane on Saturday. But the headline absence from the starting XI was Japhet Tanganga, who is on course to join Sheffield United, with a fee agreed between both clubs for the standout defender.\nIn those circumstances, and after being beaten 3-0 at home last week, many outsiders would have anticipated another difficult afternoon for Millwall at a Sheffield United side desperate for a result.\nBut instead, Millwall showed their resilience. A well-taken Luke Cundle goal in the first half gave the visitors something to hold onto and an inspired performance by goalkeeper Steven Benda backed up a well-organised and determined defensive display.\nThis was no smash-and-grab, though. Despite having just 39 per cent possession, Millwall finished the game having had more shots and more shots on target. The overall trend is upwards under the management of Alex Neil and the travelling supporters paid tribute to the latest effort at full-time - while also teasing Tanganga about his next career move.\n\"When this club's got adversity against us, it's probably when we're at our best,\" said Neil, after his side demonstrated just that in this important fixture. Peter Smith\n\nResult: Derby 1-1 Bristol City\nBristol City boss Gerhard Struber made little effort to hide where he wants to strengthen before the transfer window closes after watching his side gradually cede momentum to drop two late points at Derby on Friday.\nCity had been in the ascendency, and a goal ahead, when first-choice forward Emil Riis was forced off by injury nine minutes into the second half.\nIn his absence, City produced an xG of just 0.22, dropping deeper and deeper and eventually succumbing to Carlton Morris' equaliser four minutes from time, leaving it plain to see where the Robins' shortcomings lie even after a positive summer of incomings at Ashton Gate.\n\"When Emil went off, it's not so easy in our striker position [to] have someone behind him who is also on this level at the moment,\" he told the BBC after the game. \"It's somewhere where we had to do something.\"\nOf Struber's other options, Sinclair Armstrong remains an enigma but is extremely rough around the edges, Fally Mayulu appears again appears to have fallen out of favour and Sam Bell has precious little experience as a No 9 at this level.\nThe message from Struber was abundantly clear. The only question lies in whether he will get what he desires by September 1. Ron Walker\n\nResult: West Brom 1-1 Portsmouth\nWest Brom head coach Ryan Mason was sent off in the Baggies' draw against Portsmouth after an angry response to two big decisions not going their way, both for challenges on Aune Heggebo.\nSpeaking on Ref Watch, former England striker Jay Bothroyd sympathised with Mason.\nOn the first incident, when West Brom were denied a penalty after a foul by Connor Ogilvie, he said: \"The first one is ridiculous. I don't understand how the referee doesn't see that. That is one of the most obvious decisions we'll see all season.\"\nHeggebo was then manhandled and pulled back by Regan Poole, who was the last man.\n\n\"If he goes down there, he makes the referee have to make a decision,\" Bothroyd added.\n\"He stays strong, he's trying to be honest, he stands on his feet. He's gone through and had a shot, which is blocked. Ultimately, the referee should then bring that back. It's a red card.\n\"If the defender doesn't put his arms out and he doesn't grapple with him, he's going to take a touch forward and end up having a shot and he might score.\n\"It's still difficult as he's outside the area. It's still not an easy chance, but he's the last man.\"\nFormer Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher said he would be \"absolutely amazed\" if Mason's red card was rescinded. Dan Long\n\nResult: Norwich City 1-2 Middlesbrough\nThree from three for Middlesbrough! Two goals in quick succession at the end of the first half secured Rob Edwards' side their third win of the season and second successive away win - it's no wonder the Boro' faithful were in fine voice in the away end long after the final whistle.\nIt was an end-to-end game in the first half, before Middlesbrough broke the deadlock with some lovely one-touch football before Finn Azaz finished the move. They added a second minutes later when Aiden Morris won the ball back high and crossed it to Tommy Conway to finish from close range.\nNorwich already had an uphill battle to face in the second half, and things got even more difficult when Jacob Wright was shown a red card for his challenge on Aidan Morris.\nThe home side did rally late on, though, through the man they are so desperate to keep in Norwich colours, Josh Sargent. He dinked the ball into the back of the net following a long ball from Kenny McClean.\nHowever, it proved to be too little too late, and Middlesbrough's perfect start continues. Harriet Prior\n\nResult: Birmingham 1-0 Oxford\nIf you'd stumbled into St Andrew's on Saturday afternoon unaware which of these teams was the newly promoted side, you'd never have guessed it was Birmingham City who were playing League One football last season.\nIn fact, this was similar to a lot of games they played at that level - Chris Davies's side felt in complete control throughout, too strong, too quick, too good on the ball for Oxford who were kept at arms length.\nThe only negative was that they didn't add to Paik Seung-Ho's well-taken opener, Kyogo Furuhashi the biggest culprit in spurning two excellent first-half opportunities. But Mark Harris couldn't convert the one late chance that came Oxford's way and their head coach Gary Rowett remains the last Birmingham manager to lose a home league game some 27 matches ago.\nOxford are one of two pointless teams left in the Championship having lost their opening three matches of a season for the first time in seven years. Time to panic? Maybe not just yet. Rob Jones\nFriday\nSaturday",

        "title": "Scotland: Aaron Hickey, Ben Gannon Doak, Ryan Christie return for World Cup qualifiers away to Denmark and Belarus",
        "content": "Head coach Steve Clarke has recalled a host of familiar faces ahead of Scotland's opening World Cup qualifiers.\nBrentford right-back Aaron Hickey makes a welcome return after almost two years away from the squad following a long-term injury.\nWinger Ben Gannon Doak , who has just joined Bournemouth from Liverpool in a deal worth £25m , is also back for the first time since November.\nDoak's new club team-mate Ryan Christie missed the last camp but is now in line to make his 60th cap for the national side.\nThe goalkeeping department has caused boss Clarke some recent headaches - and they could continue next month.\nHe had given Cieran Slicker a debut against Iceland - but that didn't go to plan for the 22-year-old , and while Ross Doohan also featured in the June friendlies, he is now a back-up at Celtic.\nWhile they both drop out, Angus Gunn retains his place, but the 29-year-old has not featured for Nottingham Forest since his move in the summer - casting doubt over his readiness.\nCraig Gordon had reclaimed the gloves for Scotland's last six competitive matches. However, the 42-year-old is injured, meaning Hearts team-mate Zander Clark returns and could add to his four caps - having featured in every league game for his club this season.\nRangers' Liam Kelly is also in the squad, but is second choice at Ibrox and made just one League Cup appearance this campaign - leaving Clarke with a big call to make.\nBlackburn Rovers' Dominic Hyam makes a return for the first time in over two years in defence, alongside the likes of Hibernian's Grant Hanley , captain Andy Robertson, Celtic's Kieran Tierney and John Souttar of Rangers.\nHowever, there is no space for Everton's Nathan Patterson or Ryan Porteous who has just moved to Los Angeles.\nAt the other end of the field, Scotland fans have long awaited a prolific goalscorer. However, there is new hope that Hibernian's Kieron Bowie could fill that void.\nHe has two goals in two league games so far, plus scored a contender for goal of the season in their Conference League qualifier against Partizan.\nBowie made his debut in the 4-0 win over Liechtenstein and will be joined by Lyndon Dykes , George Hirst and Che Adams as Clarke's forward options, as Hearts' Lawrence Shankland misses out.\nLennon Miller , who moved to Udinese in a £4.7m move this month , retains his place. He's one of five players who play in the Serie A, with Ballon d'Or nominee Scott McTominay and his Napoli team-mate Billy Gilmour also in the group.\nGoalkeepers: Zander Clark (Hearts), Angus Gunn (Nottingham Forest), Liam Kelly (Rangers).\nDefenders: Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Dominic Hyam (Blackburn Rovers), Max Johnston (Sturm Graz), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic).\nMidfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Lennon Miller (Udinese).\nForwards: Che Adams (Torino), Kieron Bowie (Hibernian), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham), George Hirst (Ipswich).\nScotland boss Clarke insists he is relishing the pressure of being the person responsible for delivering Scotland's men's side to a World Cup Finals for the first time since 1998.\nHe said: \"You live on pressure in this game. If you don't thrive on the pressure, you're probably better hanging up your boots - or in my case, my whistle and stopwatch.\n\"It is something that comes with the territory. I mentioned pressure, but I also mentioned excitement because you're excited for the challenge. It is a really short qualifying campaign, six games, and we'll be ready to go.\n\"It would be great [to lead Scotland to the World Cup]. We want to be in the major tournaments - we have spoken about it. It was 1998 since the last World Cup - that's a long time, too long - so hopefully this time we can put it right.\"\n\nCaptain Andy Robertson remains optimistic about Scotland's hopes of World Cup qualification despite admitting recent results have not been \"up to scratch\".\nThey slumped to a 3-1 defeat to Iceland at Hampden Park before a 4-0 win against Liechtenstein , a team ranked 205th in the world.\nScotland have won just four of their last 16 games and at home the record stands at one victory in nine.\n\"I'm still optimistic, I'm still looking forward to the future,\" he told Sky Sports News at his AR26 golf day.\n\"We know maybe the last year and stuff hasn't been up to scratch but I still believe in the squad that we've got. I do believe that we can cause any team problems as long as we get back to the basics that we're good at.\n\"We know how hard it is to qualify for a World Cup.\n\"The last time we tried it, we had a pretty perfect campaign, only finishing a couple of points behind Denmark. We then go into the play-offs and we know how hard the games in the play-offs are.\n\"But if we get back to doing what we're good at, back to our basics, back to our basic principles, then I do believe we can give anyone a game.\n\"I think we've shown that at the highest level. We've drawn against Portugal, beaten Croatia, beat Spain.\n\"I know that feels a long time ago, but we have competed against teams when we do that right and that's what we're going to need to do for all six games to give ourselves a chance.\"",

        "title": "Evangelos Marinakis and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest storm at a lull, for now - Reporter Notebook",
        "content": "After a week where it felt like Nottingham Forest were trying to self-destruct, there is an awkward ceasefire at the City Ground as all sides plan their next manoeuvre. How lasting that truce is remains to be seen.\nThe situation is still very unpredictable, with two passionate and volatile characters at odds with each other - owner Evangelos Marinakis and manager Nuno Espirito Santo. That relationship has deteriorated for sure, possibly irrecoverably, and long term there are serious question marks about how long the Portuguese coach will continue in his role.\nBut for now, Sky Sports News has been told that there is an air of \"business as usual\" at the City Ground, with the bosses knowing that what has happened in the last 10 days has seriously impacted the stability among the squad, and the mood around the entire club.\n\nNuno has now said publicly what we reported on Friday - that he will categorically not resign . \"Never. It is absurd.\" And so if he is to leave Forest, Marinakis will have to sack him and pay him off. There is no imminent sign of the Greek billionaire wanting to do that. His mantra has always been that disagreements should be aired behind closed doors, so as to show no chink in the armour of unity. And so the manager speaking out so bluntly, and so personally, has angered him greatly.\nThere are, however, conciliatory noises coming from the manager now - he says he wants a meeting to clear the air with the owner and Edu - global head of football for all of Marinakis' clubs. But it is far from clear when that will happen. There is no such meeting currently scheduled. And it is that relationship - Nuno versus Edu - which is at the heart of the problem here.\nWhen Edu took over last month, Nuno was already in post, and he'd just signed a new contract the month before. In football - like in many other industries - when a new boss comes in, they tend to want to employ their own people. That unsettled Nuno from the start, and crucially it put a middle-man (a barrier, in Nuno's eyes) between himself and the big boss. He felt undermined, and sidelined. But what is more damaging for Forest - and a very difficult situation for Marinakis to manage - is that fundamentally Edu and Nuno do not like each other. There is a clash of character. And when that happens, it is usually the boss who wins in the long run. Edu is very obviously Nuno's boss.\nThose differences may have been put aside for now, but you sense the resentment will linger. Marinakis is not a man who takes kindly to being criticised, especially in public, and especially from his senior people. Nuno has done it twice in the space of a week.\n\nOn the eve of the opening match, he shocked Forest fans - and the owner - by openly criticising the club's lack of transfer business. He was clearly taking aim at Edu, but he hit Marinakis in the crossfire. Four new signings at a cost of £118m followed in the next week, but at his next pre-match news conference, Nuno dropped another bombshell - his relationship with the owner had deteriorated, he said: they were \"not close\", and it \"had changed\" . And when asked about a report in Spain, suggesting he was soon to be sacked, he said \"there is no smoke without fire.\"\nThe 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace saw James McAtee, Omari Hutchinson and Arnaud Kalimuendo all make their debuts, with new midfielder Douglas Luiz an unused sub. Despite that, and despite eight new signings this summer, Nuno said post-match that he still wants a new goalkeeper and two new full-backs before the transfer window closes on Monday. He is keeping the pressure up on Edu for sure.\nThe owner was never going to react quickly to Friday's criticisms and sack the manager two days before a Premier League game. But Marinakis now has a little more breathing space to consider his options - especially with the first international break of the season just a week away. That pause in the season could be crucial in seeing the relationship either mended or broken.\nMarinakis will have noticed the raucous support for Nuno from the away supporters following at Selhurst Park, with a noisy rendition of \"Nuno, Nuno, Nuno\" coming from the stands after full-time as the manager went to applaud the fans. But the owner will also have noticed a growing split in the fanbase on social media, with a growing minority speaking out against the behaviour of a man who has delivered European football, and guided the team to their highest league position since the mid-1990s.\n\nThere is currently a lull after the most bizarre and unexpected storm. But if there's one thing we have learned about the current Forest - the only certain thing is that nothing is certain.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Wolves have rejected a £50m bid from Newcastle for Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nWolves' position is that he is not for sale in this window. They believe he is too important and the lack of time left in the window is not enough to find a Premier League-ready replacement.\nWolves exercised their option to buy Strand Larsen on July 1 from Celta Vigo for £23m, after the 25-year-old Norway international spent last season at Molineux on loan.\nHe scored 14 Premier League goals in 35 appearances in 2024/25 and has started both Wolves games so far this season.\nNewcastle are targeting Strand Larsen as the replacement for Callum Wilson.\nYoane Wissa has been another player they see potentially coming in for Wilson, however Brentford rejected a £40m bid for the striker last week.\nStrand Larsen has started both of Wolves' league games so far this term.\n\nSky Sports' Adam Bate at Wolves' training ground:\nVitor Pereira has made it clear how important Jorgen Strand Larsen is to Wolves, but stopped short of guaranteeing that the Norwegian striker would remain at the club this summer amid reports of interest from Newcastle.\n\"He's a very important player for us. I never talk with him about it. He's our player. When I watch him on the training, he's committed with everybody, committed with the team. He's a fighter. He likes to win. He's preparing himself to play tomorrow.\"\nAsked if Wolves could afford to lose a key player between now and the end of the transfer window, Pereira added: \"I don't know. The market is the market. If the window is open, the players can come and the players can leave. I believe this is possible.\"\n\nEddie Howe is confident that Newcastle will not leave him without a recognised striker as the Alexander Isak situation rumbles on.\nIsak was the subject of a £110m bid from Liverpool and has not featured for Howe's first-team in a match since the Magpies players returned from pre-season.\nHowe was asked if there is a situation where Isak is sold and Newcastle do not bring a replacement in.\n\"I don't think the club will allow that situation to happen,\" he said.\n\"We certainly can't go through the season with no recognised striker at the football club - and that's no disrespect to Will Osula.\n\"I think he's doing really well and he's progressing really well, but he's got limited experience in the Premier League, although I'm really happy with his career progression.\n\"But Alex at the moment would be the only striker we have with Premier League history of goals and appearances and starts, so we can't leave ourselves in that position.\"\nSky Sports News reporter Keith Downie:\n\"For Newcastle, it feels very much at the moment like spinning plates. We don't yet know what is going to happen with Isak whether he will remain a Newcastle United player or not but they're ensuring that they're doing everything they can to get in replacements should he move to Liverpool.\n\"It will be interesting to see whether Newcastle go in with an improved bid for Strand Larsen - clearly Howe looking for striking reinforcements.\n\"They don't want to overspend though. I spoke to him just a couple of days ago in the build-up to this game. He said they don't want to overspend but they know they need strikers in because they're playing not just in the Premier League this season but they've got a Champions League campaign to contend with as well.\"\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Jamie Carragher says Newcastle should sell wantaway striker Alexander Isak before Monday's transfer deadline, comparing his situation to that of Fernando Torres at Liverpool.\nIsak has been subject of a £110m bid from Liverpool this summer, with the club also signing Hugo Ekitike after Newcastle had been strongly linked with the striker as a potential replacement for Isak.\nThe Sweden international has not been involved with the first team since the end of last season, instead training away from his team-mates with his future unresolved.\nIn a twist of fate - and with a week to go until Deadline Day - Newcastle and Liverpool face each other on Monday Night Football, and Sky Sports' Carragher offered his views on Isak's situation ahead of the game.\n\"I don't think a deal was ever going to get done before this game. I could not see that. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few days,\" he said.\n\"I can't believe that for Liverpool it is just Isak or no one but it does feel like that the closer we get to the end of the window.\n\n\"Thierry Henry said that Isak is a must for Liverpool. I have never been of that opinion - [I am] one of the few Liverpool fans who is all in on Isak and we have to spend this money.\n\"I don't think he is as durable as someone like Mo Salah. Actually, over the last three seasons he has missed 36 league games. It is almost a season out of three seasons.\n\"But I think Newcastle should sell Isak.\n\"There will be so many people outside telling Newcastle and Eddie Howe what they need to do. You have to be strong. You have to show Liverpool or any other club that players cannot just come in and demand to go.\n\"But they don't have the problem of Isak every day. They don't have the problem that Eddie Howe has of going to every press conference and being asked about it. It is a cloud over the club constantly.\n\"I have experience of it. We had this with Fernando Torres at Liverpool, where he did not really want to be at the club.\n\"He ended up staying and we sold him in the January. Those four or five months were a nightmare for the club and everyone could not wait for him to move on.\n\"It is similar to Newcastle. As a club, they are delighted to be in the Champions League and Isak is a player who wants to win it. They are not there now and he is 25 going on 26.\n\n\"When we were going for the Champions League, we had some world-class players. As soon as our level dropped, people like Torres, [Javier] Mascherano and [Xabi] Alonso - world-class players - wanted to leave because there was too much of a gap between where they are as players and where the club are.\n\"So it is not just me having a go at Newcastle and wanting their player to come to Liverpool, I have experience of that situation and when you have a player who does not want to be there it can be an absolute nightmare.\"\nFormer Arsenal striker Henry called Isak one the Premier League's best strikers right now, and agreed with Carragher that it is best if he leaves Newcastle.\n\"He's up there with, if not the, best striker in the league at the moment,\" he said on Monday Night Football.\n\"He's a great striker. What he can give you off and on the ball, the way he finishes, but when you have a player in this type of situation where he wants to leave, it's good that people are getting upset, because when a player is not good and a club wants him out, I don't see anyone crying for the player.\n\n\"I can understand the fans and the club, but I also can understand him. You always put yourself in a situation as a player where people might not understand if you don't come to training.\n\"We never know the whole story, but all I say is that you cannot put yourself in a situation when you don't come to train.\n\"In an ideal world, the best thing for him and for everybody is if he can leave, but I also do believe that when someone makes a mistake, if he apologises, then we can move on.\n\"If he scores goals and he starts to play the same way he played last year, the Newcastle fans will be OK about it.\"",

I felt the club already, even before I was in the building, just from social media and from people telling me about the club. I've never been so excited to play football and I'm just ready to get going.\n“I think it's the perfect match because of where the club is right now. Obviously with the new stadium, the fans here are unreal and it has a family feel to it. I think it was the perfect fit and was a no-brainer to join.\n“I think I’ve come to Everton at the perfect time and hopefully I can be here for many years.\n“[The Brighton win] gave me a feel for the club. It looked unbelievable. I also played in the last men’s game at Goodison. It was so loud. I was looking around and thinking, 'This is quality'. That was a really good insight for me into what it's like here with the fans and the atmosphere they can create.\n\n“There's no better feeling than when you're doing well in football and to feel that love from the fans is one of the best feelings ever. I'm excited to play here.”\nThe England U21 international made his first-team debut for Southampton as a 17-year-old in August 2023.\nOn working with Everton boss David Moyes, he said: “I think the manager is perfect for me. Obviously he's helped so many players before who were in my position. I've spoken to him and I know he's going to be good for me.\n“There are so many players here to learn from, real quality players like Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye.\n“I’d say the wow factor in my game is my dribbling. That’s what I’m best at and that’s what I want to excite the fans, and I hope I’ll get to do a lot of it.\n“My aim for this season is just to play as many games as I can and to help the team as much as I can with goals and assists. As a team, hopefully we can have a good season and see where it goes.”\n\n\nOn his latest addition, Moyes said: “We are really pleased to bring Tyler to Everton Football Club. He is a talented young English player with lots of potential.\n“Tyler adds to our attacking options and we will support him in his future development.\n“We are eager to build a team that Evertonians can enjoy watching and be proud of, and Tyler can help us achieve that.”\n\n\n\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Arne Slot criticised Newcastle's approach in Liverpool's dramatic 3-2 win at St James' Park, declaring \"that wasn't a football match\" when asked for his assessment of the game.\nLiverpool came away with a victory against 10-man Newcastle on Monday Night Football after the Magpies thought they had come from 2-0 down to secure a draw.\nSixteen-year-old Rio Ngumoha's winner 10 minutes into injury-time capped off a raucous, chaotic game that had been dominated by the future of Alexander Isak beforehand.\nThe Toon comeback was even more impressive given they played half of the game with 10 men after makeshift No 9 Anthony Gordon was sent off in first-half injury-time.\nIt was a scrappy affair from the outset with 19 fouls before the break. Newcastle then resorted their attacking play to purely set-pieces with a man fewer - a tactic that caused Liverpool problems and led to the two goals that levelled the game.\n\nAlso, the ball was in play for just 40.8 per cent of the game, which was the lowest percentage in a Premier League match since February 2010 (40 per cent in Stoke 3-0 Blackburn).\nSlot said: \"I'm not too sure if I saw a football match today. It was set-piece after set-piece, long throw.\n\"It didn't have a lot to do with tactics, what I said before the game, but I liked a lot how we stood strong. Very difficult first half hour, 45 minutes, but we didn't collapse at all, we stood strong.\n\"Going down to 10 men, you would expect that that is a big plus for us, but when a goalkeeper takes every free kick, then there's not so much help if you are one player up, and that's why it was so difficult for us to bring the 2-0 over the line.\"\nHe added: \"I don't think there was so much open play to be played.\n\"In a set-piece, a long throw-in, a long ball from the goalkeeper, you don't need an extra man. It's always nice to have an extra player on hand, but it's just not as beneficial as if they want to bring the ball out from the back and we can press them. So, yes, with the ball, the one and only attack that was good in the second half, apart from maybe the 2-0, that was the one that led to the goal, which was a great attack.\n\"And for the first time, we went from right to the middle to the left, and a great goal for a 16-year-old.\n\"Maybe it wasn't the best game in terms of tactics or in terms of playing football, but I think every fan everywhere around the world enjoyed watching this game of football, also because their fans were amazing in terms of the help they gave the home team.\"\n\nSky Sports' Jamie Carragher:\n\"There are people for Liverpool who have made a really poor start to the season. Mo Salah is one of them even though he has got a goal and an assist. [Ibrahima] Konate is another one. He has been all over the place.\n\"I want my centre-back to go and win that [challenge on Dan Burn for Newcastle's equaliser]. He was all over the place last week. He is more interested in grabbing his arm. He was really poor in the first half as well. He is not at the races at all.\n\"I absolutely shudder to think where Liverpool would be without Virgil van Dijk who has been absolutely outstanding.\"\nNewcastle head coach Eddie Howe to Sky Sports:\n\"A bruising game for us with so many different emotions.\n\"I'm really proud of the performance, really pleased with how we played, great energy, great intensity, really pleased with the following of the game plan and then adapting because we go to 10 men and for me we're the better team in the second half as well as the first.\n\n\"To come away with nothing and injuries and suspensions and concussions, it's a pretty bad day.\"",

        "title": "Rio Ngumoha: Who is 16-year-old Liverpool winger and how did he break into Arne Slot's first-team squad?",
        "content": "Despite spending just shy of £300m in this transfer window on new signings, it was Rio Ngumoha who stepped up when Liverpool needed him most.\nIn the 100th minute in a topsy-turvy game at Newcastle, the 16-year-old was the coolest man in the St James' Park cauldron as he curled home the winner in a dramatic 3-2 victory for Arne Slot's Premier League champions.\nIt was the latest standout moment in a stellar summer for the teenager. Three goals, including two stunning individual efforts, and two more assists in pre-season offered a glimpse into the mercurial talent that has already left a huge impression on the club's fans.\n\nBut Ngumoha has shown he can do it on the biggest stage.\nDirect, dynamic and a maturity beyond his years best describe Ngumoha's game - all traits that led Liverpool to poach the winger from Chelsea last summer.\nSo, what do we know about Ngumoha? And how much more might we see of him this Premier League season?\n\nNgumoha, born in Newham, east London, joined Chelsea aged eight. The wide man, who represented England at youth level, quickly rose through the ranks with the west Londoners, featuring for the club's U21 side at just 15 years old.\nHowever, Ngumoha opted to join Liverpool in the summer of 2024 after the Reds went all out to convince him to move to Merseyside, with former Chelsea captain John Terry, who has been involved in the Blues' academy set-up, predicting he would go on to become a \"top, top player\".\nNgumoha is understood to have been attracted by the proven pathway from Liverpool's youth ranks to the first team, as seen on numerous occasions during previous manager Jurgen Klopp's time in charge, while Slot has also demonstrated a willingness to give youth a chance since replacing the German at Anfield last summer.\n\nStarting out initially with Liverpool's U18 side, Ngumoha has enjoyed a rapid rise to the club's first-team picture since making the move north.\nSlot believed Ngumoha would benefit hugely from getting the opportunity to learn from players like Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, understanding exactly what one needs to do to be ready to perform every three days at the highest level.\nAs a result, in December of last year Ngumoha was named on the bench as Liverpool travelled to Southampton for a Carabao Cup clash, before becoming the Reds' youngest-ever player to start a competitive fixture when Accrington Stanley visited Anfield for an FA Cup third-round tie in January.\nAnd since his debut at the turn of the year, the wide man has been splitting training time between the academy and first team.\nNgumoha was then included in the Liverpool squad for the pre-season tour to Hong Kong and Japan this summer, with Luis Diaz's exit to Bayern Munich providing the perfect opportunity for Slot to slowly integrate the left-sided forward into the first team.\nAnd boy has the 16-year-old grabbed that chance with both hands, scoring eye-catching solo strikes in wins against Yokohama F Marinos and Athletic Club that showed just why Chelsea were so reluctant to see him leave their academy last summer.\nIn fact, the youngster needed only five minutes to register a goal and assist against Athletic at Anfield, with Ben Gannon Doak - now at Bournemouth - singing his praises, telling LFCTV: \"That guy is ridiculous. He is going to have some career ahead of him!\n\"So sharp and so talented. If he can keep going the way he is going, anything is possible.\"\nSlot has understandably at times this summer tried to dampen down expectations around Nguhoma given how intense the Premier League can be a lot for players in their early twenties, let alone his age.\n\"Rio is showing good things in every game in pre-season,\" said the Reds boss after the win against Yokohama F. Marinos, before quickly keeping his feet on the ground by adding: \"There was a moment where he should've squared it, so he can learn.\n\"But if you are 16 and you impact the game like he did, that's definitely a compliment.\"\nAfter his heroics in Newcastle, Jamie Carragher now believes Ngumoha \"has got to be involved\" in Liverpool's season - which will include a Premier League title defence and a bid to regain the Champions League trophy.\n\"It is difficult to create history at Liverpool because the club has got such great history. But there has been something about this lad in pre-season where Liverpool supporters are getting really excited,\" said Carragher on Monday Night Football.\n\"Luis Diaz has moved on and he was the competition for Cody Gakpo on the left. There is a feeling that Liverpool have to replace Luis Diaz but what do you do when you have a young player like this?\n\n\"That is definitely going to be in the minds of the Liverpool hierarchy in terms of what they do in the next week because when someone has an impact like that as a young player, that is not enough now.\n\"I am not talking about him playing every week but he has shown himself in a big moment, a high-pressure moment, composure at such a delicate stage of the game.\n\"You cannot not see him now on the bench and coming on in games for the next two or three months. He has got to be involved.\"\nLiverpool captain Van Dijk, meanwhile, has erred on the side of caution. \"I'm very, very pleased for Rio,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\"I've mentioned it before to him already, it's all a start now, he has to keep working hard and stay humble. He has to enjoy this, because these nights you can't take for granted, of course, if you're in his position.\n\"And I'm sure with the players that we have, he will be back in training and having a hard session tomorrow again.\"\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Alexander Isak transfer news: Newcastle directors visit exiled forward amid ongoing stand-off over St James' Park future",
        "content": "Newcastle directors Jamie Reuben and Jacobo Solis visited Alexander Isak at his house yesterday ahead of the game with Liverpool.\nThe group held talks about the striker's future, which remains up in the air with less than a week of the transfer window remaining.\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said he wanted clarity on the situation in his post-match following the late home defeat to Liverpool.\nWhen asked about the talks by Sky Sports immediately after the 3-2 defeat, he said: \"I wasn't aware of it. Talks have been going on since Alex decided not to go on tour with us. I've concentrated on coaching the team so I've got no update for you.\"\nNewcastle chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan was present at the game but was not part of the talks with Isak at his house earlier in the day.\nNewcastle currently have six directors, including Al-Rumayyan who was at St James' Park on Monday evening.\nJacobo Solis is the head of public investments for Saudi PIF, the fund that owns Newcastle, and is the newest member of the club's board after being named a director last December. He previously worked as an investment banker in the USA. He is also involved in LIV Golf and the E1 power-boating series.\nJamie Reuben is the son of British billionaire investor David Reuben, and has been a co-owner of Newcastle since 2021. He was previously on the board of directors at QPR.\nSky Sports News reporter Keith Downie:\n\"The positive thinking Newcastle fans could read into this [meeting] that they are trying to come to some sort of agreement to re-integrate Alexander Isak into the first-team squad and be available to Eddie Howe going forward.\n\"I would suggest if he does remain a Newcastle player, he won't be available to play against Leeds this weekend either way.\n\"But the more pessimistic may think perhaps it's a meeting to work out the finality of the situations. But until we find out what happened within those four walls, all options are on the table.\n\"Isak would still like to move away from the club and it's dragged on for a long time now. It would be difficult to reintegrate into the squad given the strength of feeling of the supporters.\n\"Some of the things I heard last night at St James' Park and then we see the banners, I think it would be difficult to re-integrate - but if Liverpool don't come to the table with an acceptable offer, he will remain a Newcastle player.\n\"What has been the case for a number of weeks now is that Newcastle are getting desperate when it comes to replacements; they tried Ekitike, they tried Sesko, they missed out on Joao Pedro and Delap. They've tried and failed a number of times - and if they manage to get one in, or possibly two, there's a chance Isak may leave by the end of the transfer window.\"\nHowe revealed in his post-match press conference that he has not spoken to Isak for almost a week, and said his full focus had been on preparing his team for the Monday Night Football clash.\nThe Newcastle boss further admitted he would prefer to have Isak's situation sorted before the end of the transfer window, which closes at 11pm on September 1 - but is leaving the 25-year-old's future up to those above him at St James' Park.\nHe said: \"I've not been party to talks on this for a long time now. I've been concentrating on preparing the team and giving all my energy to the players who want to play for Newcastle, I think that's where it's best placed now.\n\"It would be ideal to have clarity and move forward, and change the narrative because it's the start of the season and we've got to get results and focus on what we can control.\n\"The quality of Alex would've made a difference in the two games, there's no denying that. But the team has functioned really well. That doesn't happen without every part of the team functioning well.\"\n\nNewcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes to Sky Sports:\n\"We always try to give our best, it's exactly what the message means. No one wins if the team loses. There's a lot of noise outside we can't control.\n\"I can't say anything, it's much bigger than me and I'm not in control of things going on outside. The focus is just to play for the club, make the fans proud and I think they left the stadium thinking that today. We lost but football is like that sometimes.\"\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Brentford are considering a move for Borussia Dortmund's Max Beier.\nThere has been no approach to Dortmund yet, though, and he is one several forward players Brentford are looking at.\nBrentford are in the market for someone who plays predominantly off the left-hand side to potentially replace Newcastle target Yoane Wissa . The Bees want a replacement secured before letting Wissa go.\nBeier can play anywhere across the front line but has mostly been a centre-forward at Dortmund. He is someone of long-term interest to Brentford, who tried to sign him last summer.\nThe 22-year-old Germany international signed for Dortmund instead and made 46 appearances last term, most of which were off the bench. He was also left on the bench for Dortmund's opening Bundesliga game against St Pauli.\nDortmund are getting closer to an agreement with Wolves for striker Fabio Silva and, if they sign him, it may limit Beier's game-time further.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Keith Andrews said he \"fully expects\" Wissa to still be a Brentford player after the summer transfer window closes.\nThe forward has not played for the Bees this season, as speculation around his future continues to swirl.\n\"It's very similar, stroke the exact same, as where we were pre-Villa,\" he said in a press conference on Monday afternoon ahead of playing Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports+.\n\"He won't be involved [vs Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup]. Again, it's just a decision based around what I feel is best for the group.\n\"The focus is on the group tomorrow. Yoane won't be involved. As far as I'm concerned, there's been no movement in any way and I fully expect Yoane to be here come next Tuesday.\"\nAsked if Wissa would be able to be reintegrated into the squad if he does not leave west London, Andrews added: \"That's the plan. If I didn't think it would be, my stance on it would probably be different.\n\"We've got a phenomenal group of players and staff that has been built over numerous years, where there's a real culture of togetherness, a real underpinning of respect throughout the building.\n\"People walk in and they feel that.

        "title": "Max Dowman: Arsenal midfielder, 15, being considered for England U19 squad after impressive Premier League debut",
        "content": "The FA's youth team coaches are considering promoting Max Dowman to England's U19 squad after his impressive Premier League debut for Arsenal against Leeds.\nThe 15-year-old has been capped 16 times at U17 level, scoring five international goals, and was a key member of England's U17 squad in the summer, starting each of their three European Championship games.\nNow - after winning a penalty against Leeds in Saturday's 5-0 victory for Arsenal - there is a possibility he will jump another age group, in recognition of his progress in senior football.\nBut for that to happen - because Dowman is still a minor - it will need the agreement of both his family and Arsenal. His development will be carefully managed - by club and country.\nHis team-mate Ethan Nwaneri - the only Arsenal player to make his Premier League debut at a younger age than Dowman - was promoted to England's U21 side in March, at the age of 17, after careful consideration of his readiness.\nNwaneri went on to be a key player for Lee Carsley's team as they retained their Euros crown in June, featuring in all six matches.\nThe feeling around Dowman, Sky Sports News has been told, is similar - in that many in the FA feel he is now ready to step up to the U19s, but more discussions will be held before any final decision is taken.\nGunners boss Mikel Arteta has no doubts about Dowman's pedigree, and his appetite for big games, saying after Saturday's match with Leeds: \"There is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that at 15 he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life.\n\"For us he brings joy, he brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.\"\nThe teenager has been involved with England's junior teams for several years, making his international debut for the U16s - and then the U17s - in 2024.\nHowever, the FA and Arsenal are mindful that he still has to take his GCSEs next spring and, because of his age, he cannot play Champions League football until January 1, 2026.\nDowman stood out in pre-season for Arsenal, coming off the bench on numerous occasions and impressing Arteta with the impact he made.\nThat prompted Arteta to bring him on at the Emirates on Saturday - albeit with his side already 4-0 up. In doing so, at 15 years and 234 days old, Dowman became the second youngest player to feature for Arsenal.\n\nDowman instantly excited the home crowd with a number of runs down the right wing and won the penalty in stoppage time that Viktor Gyokeres converted for 5-0.\n\"Ball carrying has been his super strength all the way through,\" former Arsenal academy coach Temisan Williams - now founder of Coach Accelerator Masterclass Community - told Sky Sports .\n\"I got to coach Max for the whole season when he was an U11s player and right from the get-go I was like: 'Okay, there's something very special about this young man'.\"\nDowman is now the most talked-about teenager in the Premier League. He's ticked off his first-team and then competitive debuts in a matter of weeks. All this sparks the question: How far can he go? And how quickly?\n\"Champions League, World Cup, Premier League,\" says Williams. \"He's got all the capabilities; he's got the mentality. Mikel Arteta wouldn't bring him into the fold at that age if he didn't.\"\nThere can be little doubt anymore - Max Dowman is Next Up .\nRead more on Max Dowman's development in the Arsenal academy here.\nThe Emirates Stadium crackled with anticipation every time the ball arrived at the feet of Dowman. As in Arsenal's pre-season games, his team-mates made a concerted effort to put it there. It is easy to understand why. The 15-year-old is a special talent.\nLeeds could not contain him. The drop of the shoulder to win Arsenal's late penalty capped a thrilling debut. On a day of theatre, of unveilings, injuries and first goals, it was Dowman, a schoolboy still four months shy of his 16th birthday, who stole the show.\nDowman might be Arsenal's most exciting academy product yet. He certainly looks uniquely ready for the step up at his age. But he is just the latest player off the club's production line in recent years.\nHale End continues to deliver.\nRead more about how Arsenal's academy has had a major impact on the Gunners' value here.",

        "content": "Brendan Rodgers called Celtic's demotion to the Europa League a \"huge blow\" for the club, following a 3-2 penalty shoot-out loss to Kairat Almaty.\nCeltic, who reached the Champions League knockout stages last season, drop into the second-tier competition after a goalless 210 minutes led to a nervy shoot-out in eastern Kazakhstan, where the game was staged 250 miles from the Chinese border.\nAdam Idah, Luke McCowan and Daizen Maeda all saw penalties saved by Kairat's 21-year-old second-choice goalkeeper Temirlan Anarbekov, as they became just the second Kazakh side to earn a place in the Champions League proper.\nRodgers told Amazon Prime : \"It's very frustrating. We showed a glimpse of what we can do at this level but we haven't been able to show that over the course of these two games.\n\"It's bitterly disappointing, because we were on the right track last season and working really well and playing really good football, so to not be in there this season is a huge blow for us. We missed a massive opportunity over these two games.\"\nMaeda blazed over from a glorious chance in the 86th minute before Celtic were denied on a series of occasions as they finally began to dominate in extra-time, but failed to convert.\nThe delay in crucial transfer activity has taken its latest damaging turn, with the club paying a hefty price after failing to replace Kyogo Furuhashi and Nicolas Kuhn this summer.\nCeltic have spent about £3million on transfers so far this summer, while bringing in around £20m - a sum similar to what they will miss out on following their failure to reach the Champions League proper.\nOnly two summer signings - Kieran Tierney and Benjamin Nygren - featured in Kazakhstan and the anticipated arrivals of Antwerp winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha and Boca Juniors left-back Marcelo Saracchi will come in the wake of fan anger.\nRodgers has been calling for attacking reinforcements since July, having missed out on a number of targets.\n\"We showed last year the strides I felt we took but you have to build on that,\" Rodgers added.\n\"The last thing you want to do in football is manufacture your own stress but all we can do now is look at where we're at as a football club and decide where we want to go.\n\"I thought overall it was a poor game. The pitch made it awful. We were defensively OK but couldn't quite make the breakthrough. We had good chances, especially in the second half and extra-time, and when it goes to penalties anything can happen.\n\"We just have to reflect on opportunities that we didn't take and we have to settle for the Europa League.\"\n\nFormer Celtic defender Mark Wilson speaking on Sky Sports News:\n\"It's tough to explain, there will be a lot of questions and fallout with a narrative of a lack of investment. There's a young right-back that finishes the game, a young centre-back, a centre-back at left-back.\n\"There are questions that need to be answered. Did the Celtic board gamble on the players that they've got to get them through?\n\"It's backfired dramatically and they pay the price. They've been poor over 210 minutes of football; created very little. Kairat were robust, made it difficult and they've got their reward. It's a real sobering moment for Celtic.\"\nAnalysis by Sky Sports' Laura Hunter:\nIt's hard to have much sympathy for Celtic and Brendan Rodgers after such a severe underperformance across two sets of woeful 90 minutes. They only have themselves to blame. And when the tie went to penalties, the sense of foreboding was overwhelming.\nKairat, a team in complete European obscurity until now, had more efforts on Celtic's goal on the night. For everything they lacked in quality, they made up in heart and spirit. They won more tackles, made more interceptions and completed more clearances. They won the duel count 75-63.\nThe Celtic board's unpopular decision to wait to do transfer business until Champions League qualification was secure has been rendered ridiculous. Rodgers will be rightly upset by that. But he still needs to inspire more from the players he does have.\nTo create so little against a team with so much less pedigree is inexcusable. His currency has got to be at its lowest since he rejoined the club back in 2023. Tough conversations ahead.",

        "title": "Liverpool a test of depth for Arsenal but Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke ease Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard worry",
        "content": "The last time Arsenal visited Anfield, for the 2-2 draw with Liverpool in May, Mikel Arteta only needed to glance over his shoulder for a reminder of their lack of depth.\nIn Kieran Tierney, Raheem Sterling, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Neto, Nathan Butler-Oyedeji and Jack Henry-Francis, six of the nine players seated on the Arsenal bench had played barely 1,000 minutes between them in the Premier League all season.\nFive of the six have subsequently gone. Zinchenko may well follow before the transfer deadline. All, though, appeared regularly in Arsenal's matchday squads last term, making up the numbers as injury problems exposed a shallow pool of trusted options.\nThree months on, the picture looks very different.\n\nInjuries that would have previously had fans writing off their chances at Anfield - to Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz - no longer feel disastrous, such is the squad's transformation.\nThe investment has been comprehensive.\nThe £67.5m arrival of Eberechi Eze took Arsenal's spending to £267m this summer. Eze is their seventh signing of the window after Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard, Noni Madueke, Cristhian Mosquera and Viktor Gyokeres.\nArteta's squad has been strengthened in all departments. But it is in attack that they hope to feel the benefits at Anfield on Sunday.\nArsenal may have to do without Saka, Havertz and Odegaard as well as long-term absentee Gabriel Jesus. But with Eze, Madueke and Gyokeres added to a pool of forwards that also includes Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Ethan Nwaneri and the emerging Max Dowman, they still have enviable options.\n\"They don't want to lose Havertz, they don't want to lose Saka, they don't want to lose Odegaard, but they have got better options behind them now,\" said Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville.\n\n\"That is what we need,\" added Arteta in his press conference after the 5-0 win over Leeds. \"I think the other way is not realistic to survive at the level we want for 10 months. None of the other top teams in the league do it, so why are we going to be different?\"\nTheir injuries throw up an early test of their increased depth, and their new signings are likely to play an important role in how they navigate it, with Gyokeres expected to lead the line at Anfield and Eze and Madueke providing new options in support.\nThe pair have added creativity, flair and ball-carrying ability, among other qualities. But they were signed for their versatility too. Madueke has already been used on both flanks by Arteta. Eze is of course comfortable centrally as well as out wide.\nEze's minutes were split between multiple positions at Crystal Palace but most of his best work came as a No 10. He therefore becomes an option to replace Odegaard, if he is unavailable, with Martin Zubimendi and Declan Rice ensuring defensive cover.\nMadueke could then take Saka's role on the right, which would allow some familiarity on the left. Martinelli was an unused substitute against Leeds but he tends to fare well against Liverpool, who have shown vulnerability on the break this season.\nArsenal have made a clear effort to increase their threat in those situations. Gyokeres, Madueke and Eze all excel at attacking space on transitions. But the same can be said of Martinelli, a player once described as \"a talent of the century\" by Jurgen Klopp.\nThe Brazil international has scored four goals in his last six appearances against the Reds, including the header which sparked Arsenal's comeback in the 2-2 draw in May.\nMartinelli was named player of the match for his display that day, making a season-high total of 41 off-the-ball runs as he repeatedly tried to exploit Liverpool's high line. But the cross for his goal was supplied by another player with a strong record against them.\nIn fact, Trossard is one of only three opposition players, along with Andrey Arshavin and Peter Ndlovu, to have scored a hat-trick in a Premier League game at Anfield following his treble for former club Brighton in a 3-3 draw there in January 2022.\nThe Belgium international will also be pushing for inclusion having looked bright off the bench against Leeds but Eze has inflicted damage from the left flank at Anfield too, scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory for Crystal Palace in April 2024.\nArteta could opt to install Eze on that side and, if Odegaard is unavailable, use Nwaneri in midfield.\nNwaneri was predominantly used on the right flank last season, deputising for Saka during his injury absence. But his first-half introduction for Odegaard against Leeds hinted at where his future lies. He performed well, completing all 26 of his passes.\nRepeating that feat in the cauldron of Anfield would be an altogether different challenge for Nwaneri but the 18-year-old provides his manager with another credible option.\nAlternatively, Arteta could call on Mikel Merino, who scored Arsenal's equaliser from midfield on their last visit to Anfield and might be better-equipped to deal with the physical demands of the game.\n\"I think he'll bring Merino in,\" added Neville. \"What he'll do is he'll make it a lot stronger, a lot more physical. That's what I would do and I think that's what Arteta will do. He'll go with one of his more powerful players in there.\"\nArsenal's injuries are of course far from ideal regardless of who steps into the team. Saka, in particular, has been vitally important in recent seasons, as Arsenal's record with and without him shows.\nTheir Premier League win rate drops significantly when the 23-year-old doesn't start, their scoring rate even more so.\nBut Arsenal's summer business has been geared towards precisely this, towards easing that dependence on individuals. Madueke provides a proven, high-calibre alternative in Saka's position. There is now flexibility across the front line, as in defence and midfield.\nIt could be argued that, in Gyokeres and Eze, only two of Arsenal's seven signings provide obvious upgrades to Arteta's starting line-up. But their depth of quality is transformed from last season.\nIt will be evident in the players seated over Arteta's shoulder at Anfield on Sunday as well as those on the pitch in front of him.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage is increasing from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Rangers have accepted a bid from Lille for wantaway striker Hamza Igamane.\n\nIt is understood that the French club have met the £10.4m (€12m) release clause in his contract.\nIgamane has agreed terms on a five-year contract ahead of his medical, with the clubs finalising legal documents.\n\nSky Sports News revealed on Tuesday that the 22-year-old missed training ahead of Rangers' Champions League play-off clash against Club Brugge. However, it is understood he was not injured for the session.\n\nThat followed Sunday’s draw at St Mirren, where the player refused to come on as a substitute, claiming he was injured.\nLille had reopened talks with Ibrox chiefs this week, after an initial loan bid was rejected and are now set to sign the player.\nDutch side Feyenoord had also been keen on Igamane, who scored 16 times in his first season at Ibrox.\n\n\nSpeaking ahead of their Champions League play-off clash against Club Brugge, Martin said: \"I think I always just said to the players, you know, just be honest with yourself and with us as team-mates. I'd much rather that happen before the game than during it.\n\"It's happened, we moved forward, we dealt with it, he's got what he wanted. He looks likely to get what he wanted to play somewhere else and it means we've got a sum of money that we wanted for him.\n\"Ideally it wouldn't have happened but it did and now we've moved forward and we can move on.\"\nAsked if Igamane's scan revealed an injury issue, Martin said: \"I expect him to pass his medical.\"\n\nFollowing his former side's draw away to St Mirren, Sky Sports' Kris Boyd said:\n\"I think I said it a couple of weeks ago, I think the players have been running the club for far too long. Listen, if he's injured, he's injured. I highly doubt it.\n\"If that is the case, if I'm Rangers Football Club I'd drive him to the airport and say goodbye. If you've not got people who are willing to knuckle down and help this team at this moment of time, then see you later.\n\"If you don't there's a real danger. It's at boiling point right now with the fans. If Russell Martin is not strong, and doesn't see this through, he's going to join Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Michael Beale, Philippe Clement out the door.\n\"He needs to get the right type of characters in this dressing room and quick. I do question if Martin is a little too honest. After a game, emotions are still high and if you've turned to your bench for a striker that the fans think is the blue-eyed boy; I've not seen what everybody thinks.\n\"On a consistent basis, Hamza Igamane hasn't done what everyone thinks he's done for Rangers. He's another one who is inflated and everybody thinks is better than he is.\"",

        "title": "Premier League sides smash transfer record as spending passes £2.6bn but where is your club stronger or weaker?",
        "content": "Premier League clubs have set a new record for spending in a single transfer window this summer at over £2.6bn.\nArsenal's signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace saw the previous record fall with a week of the window still to go.\nBut how has the money been spent? Using net-spend figures, this week's Between the Lines looks at the positions in which clubs have strengthened this summer - and where they have got weaker.\nNearly half of the £2.6bn spent this summer has gone on forwards. At a whopping £1.4bn, Premier League clubs have splurged roughly £850m more on forward players than on players in any other position, with defenders next on £547m.\nThe figures highlight the huge value placed on attacking players, particularly in a summer when many of the Premier League's top clubs have been looking to add more firepower.\nThe most high-profile movers include Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Joao Pedro. But with the Alexander Isak saga rumbling on, the total could soar even higher before Monday's transfer deadline.\nNet spend, which factors money received in sales, adds another layer of insight and underlines the scale of the investment made by some of the Premier League's elite sides.\nManchester United sit top, having added Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha as well as Sesko for £207.5m combined. Marcus Rashford has left on loan to Barcelona, but they are yet to offset that spending by selling any of their existing options permanently.\nArsenal are not far behind them for net spend on forwards, with Eze following Noni Madueke and Gyokeres to the club at a combined cost of £180.5m before having made any sales.\nChelsea have also spent heavily, with Joao Pedro one of four attacking signings, but the sales of Madueke, Joao Felix and Armando Broja have helped reduce their net spend to £55m.\n\nWhile some clubs have bolstered their attacks, others have taken a hit - none more so than Crystal Palace , whose frontline is £67.5m lighter after Eze's move to Arsenal.\nMeanwhile, West Ham have made a net profit of £55m on forwards, having not yet replaced Mohammed Kudus, who joined Spurs for £55m, leaving them light in their front line.\nFurther investment may also be needed at Brighton , Brentford and Wolves, who are ostensibly weaker in attack, with negative net spends, having lost Joao Pedro, Cunha and Mbeumo, respectively.\nMoving on to midfield and, following the signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and no sales, Arsenal come out top for net spend on £66m as things stand.\nMuch of the focus is on Mikel Arteta's attack following their investment this summer but their midfield has also been significantly reinforced, with Zubimendi going straight into the starting line-up following his £51m arrival from Real Sociedad.\nEverton and Sunderland are next highest for net spend on midfielders. The Toffees have added Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Charly Alcaraz without losing anyone, while the promoted Black Cats have signed Enzo Le Fee, Granit Xhaka and Habib Diarra to offset the sale of Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund.\nManchester United are one of six clubs with a net spend of zero on midfielders, although that could change before the deadline, with Kobbie Mainoo's future uncertain and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville saying they need to strengthen the position as a priority.\n\nAlong with Chelsea , Aston Villa currently have a notable negative net spend on midfielders, owing to the £43m sale of Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle. The club are yet to replace the 24-year-old, or bring in any bodies in midfield, leaving Unai Emery with fewer options than last season.\nBournemouth stand out for net spend on defenders. Having lost three members of their first-choice back four last season in Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez for fees worth a combined £144.5m, they are in profit to the tune of £98m.\nReplacements have so far been recruited for lower costs, with centre-back Bafode Diakite joining from Lille for £35m and left-back Adrien Truffert arriving from Rennes for £14.4m. Their strong starts show there is value to be found in the market, as Bournemouth previously showed with Huijsen, Zabarnyi and Kerkez.\nAndoni Iraola will, however, need more backing defensively. They are still down a body at centre-back. But the club will aim to find the requisite quality while remaining in profit.\nIt may seem hard to believe on the back of their 5-1 thrashing by Chelsea, and their subsequent 3-2 loss to Wolves in the Carabao Cup, but the side to have strengthened their defence most, in terms of net spend, is West Ham , who have signed Jean-Clair Todibo following his loan spell for £35m and also added full-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.\n\nLiverpool currently have the second-highest net spend on defenders, with Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giovanni Leoni arriving after Real Madrid paid £10m for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Jarell Quansah left for Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.\nBut their figure could rise further if they add another centre-back, with Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi still a possibility.\nManchester City are the biggest net spenders on goalkeepers so far having re-signed James Trafford for £31m, and there could be more activity as there is uncertainty around the future of Ederson amid links with Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nBy selling Trafford to his boyhood club, Burnley are at the other end of the net spend on goalkeepers table, with Martin Dubravka and Max Weiss arriving for much lower fees, leaving them weakened in the position on paper.\nBetween the Lines , a weekly Sky Sports strand revealing the data behind football's biggest stories, put squad values under the microscope last week to rank and analyse the eight most valuable squads in the world.

        "title": "Man Utd 4-0 PSV: Elisabeth Terland scores hat-trick as Marc Skinner's side move closer to Champions League qualifcation",
        "content": "Elisabeth Terland's hat-trick propelled Manchester United one step forward in their Champions League qualifying campaign with a dominant 4-0 victory over PSV Eindhoven.\nThe Norway international scored in the seventh, 53rd and 63rd minute in Stockholm, where Celin Bizet-Donnum also added a first-half goal.\nUnited, who finished third in last season's Women's Super League, entered the competition in this second qualifying round semi-final, and will now take on the winner of Hammarby vs Metalist Kharkiv on Saturday.\nThe winners of that match enter the league path of the third qualifying round, while the losers will drop into UEFA's new Women's Europa Cup.\nUnited forced PSV into an early mistake from their high press, empowering Lisa Naalsund to tee up Terland for the opener.\nSummer signing Julia Zigiotti Olme then clipped a post from Terland's squared pass, and there were a pair of chances for Ella Toone before the Norwegian striker had the ball in the back of the net again, latterly ruled out for offside.\nIt was not long before United scored for a second time, orchestrated by Bizet-Donnum, who won the ball back before eventually working it to Toone via Anna Samberg's cross.\nThe England midfielder's initial shot was saved, but Bizet-Donnum was the fastest to react and lifted the ball beyond goalkeeper Moon Biegel Esteves in the 32nd minute.\nPSV started the second half strongly before Terland made it 3-0 after more loose defending from the Dutch outfit allowed Toone to intervene and slip a perfectly-weighted pass for the Norwegian striker to finish clinically.\nTerland then grabbed her hat-trick and put the contest out of reach with an excellent finish after playing a one-two with Toone before slotting the ball past Biegel Esteves.\nAnalysis by Sky Sports' Laura Hunter:\nQualifying for the Champions League proper has long been a Manchester United mission - and remains a necessary part of their evolution under Marc Skinner.\nThey feel as if they made decent strides last year but to continue to progress, attract top talent in the market, and mix it regularly with the WSL's best, they have to be competing in Europe's elite competition.\nThere will be some relief after overcoming a potential banana skin in PSV, who finished runners-up in the Dutch league last year. But in UEFA's elaborate qualification process, United still need to win on Saturday, and then enter a two-legged third qualifying-round tie in September.\nIf they do make it to the Champions League proper it will be well earned. And a significant breakthrough in the club's growing ambition to be viewed among the game's top-tier teams.",

        "content": "Newcastle are expected to make an improved offer worth £60m for Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nWolves rejected a second offer worth £55m from the Magpies after the 25-year-old scored two late goals to beat West Ham 3-2 to reach the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday.\nNo improved offer has gone in yet. The first offer of £50m was rejected on Monday.\nWolves manager Vitor Pereira admitted after the win against West Ham that \"every player has a price\" in the post-match press conference.\n\nHowever, Wolves' position is that he is not for sale in this window, especially with such little time to find a Premier League-ready replacement.\nWolves paid £23m for Strand Larsen earlier this summer, after his loan deal at Molineux became an obligation to buy, following certain playing criteria being met.\nNewcastle are in the market for a striker with the future of Alexander Isak still uncertain as Deadline Day approaches on September 1.\nNewcastle directors Jamie Reuben and Jacobo Solis visited Isak at his house on Monday before the 3-2 loss to Liverpool, the club heavily linked with the player, but Sky Sports News understands a resolution to the situation was not met.\nIsak informed the Magpies that he wanted to explore his options earlier in the window, with a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected on August 1.\n\nSky Sports News' Keith Downie :\n\"The player is open to move and while he is not agitating to leave, he is open to a move to Newcastle.\n\"Wolves want to make sure it is a fee they are acceptable with. Clearly, £55m is not enough. They are working in the background to sign a replacement to allow Strand Larsen to leave.\n\"If one or two dominoes fall, we might see a quick movement in the whole transfer market.\"\nSky Sports News' Rob Dorsett :\n\"A Premier League-ready replacement. That's the point.\n\"Jorgen Strand Larsen is a key part of the Wolves side, he's such an important player for them.\n\n\"They can't just buy a young player or take a risk on somebody from a European club who doesn't know the Premier League, and just throw him in there and expect him to do a job. It would leave a big hole in the Wolves squad.\n\"For Wolves to accept an offer for him at this stage, it has to be a big bid. And the big question is: is this new £60m bid - when it goes in - big enough to persuade them to sell?\n\"It would be a good level of profit for them. He was on loan at Celta Vigo last season and there was an obligation to buy him for £23m. They've just spent £23m on him and they could then sell him for £60m.\n\"That sounds like a good bit of business - until you start thinking about where they are going to get a replacement from.\"\nLatest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett :\nBorussia Dortmund have agreed a £22.8m (€26.5m) deal with Wolves for Fabio Silva.\nThe striker was flying to Germany for a medical on Wednesday. AC Milan and Roma were also interested, but the player prefers a move to the Bundesliga.\nSilva, 23, moved to Molineux from Porto for £35m in 2020 but has spent time on loan at PSV, Anderlecht, Rangers and Las Palmas after failing to secure a starting spot at the club.\nHe has made a total of 72 appearances for Wolves, scoring five goals and adding six assists.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "content": "Tottenham Hotspur's priority in the final days of the transfer window is signing a No 10 after missing out on key targets Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze.\nSpurs have registered an interest in RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons , Sky Sports News understands - however it is nothing more than that at this stage with Chelsea considered frontrunners for his signature.\nLucas Paqueta is admired but there is currently no indication West Ham would consider a sale.\nSimilarly, Morgan Rogers is another player of interest but Aston Villa consider him not for sale and there has been no movement, as things stand.\nGibbs-White was seen as the ideal player for head coach Thomas Frank - but Spurs insist they could not have done much more in what they felt was a bizarre few weeks with Nottingham Forest.\nEze joining Arsenal at the last-minute was a huge blow for a number of reasons and the information that has emerged since he signed has only reinforced why a few figures at Spurs were never totally convinced he was going to play for the club.\n\nSpurs maintain, as they did with Gibbs-White, that they did all they could to get a deal over the line. They felt they had an agreement in place with both Crystal Palace and the player.\nNico Paz is well-liked internally at Spurs but a deal for the Como attacking midfielder is considered a non-starter due to Real Madrid's financial interest in the player. They have a 50 per cent sell-on inserted in his contract and a buy-back clause worth £8.7m.\nLeft-wing is another position that Spurs are looking at before the window closes - and it is no secret that they want to sign Savinho .\nAs it stands, Man City do not want to sell and will only negotiate if they get a replacement and it is believed that target has been Rodrygo at Real Madrid .\n\nBringing in a defender is considered the third most important priority.\nFrank giving the green light to for Luka Vuskovic to join Hamburg on loan could be an indication that there is confidence at Spurs that a centre-back will come in. Ideally it would be a left-footed one.\nBayer Leverkusen centre-back Piero Hincapie had his admirers inside the club but is not a player they're considering amid interest from Arsenal . With Frank often switching to a back three, a late move for a senior defender remains possible.\n\nOne of the early plus points for Frank's reign has been the midfield. Joao Palhinha has been outstanding since arriving from Bayern Munich on loan and its clear Spurs were crying out for a tough tackling midfielder last season.\nThe midfield trio he formed with Rodrigo Bentancur and Pape Sarr - arguably the most impressive player under Frank thus far - played a key role in Saturday's impressive win at Manchester City.\nSpurs are now looking to further bolster their new coach's options, particularly in attacking and creative areas, as Frank looks to build on a promising start to life in north London and prepares for a demanding Champions League campaign.",

        "title": "Russell Martin: Rangers boss retains board support as Kris Boyd questions keeping him in charge at Ibrox",
        "content": "Russell Martin will take charge of Rangers against Celtic after the Ibrox board backed the under-fire head coach after their humiliating thrashing by Club Brugge.\nSky Sports News understands his position is not under consideration ahead of Sunday's Old Firm clash at Ibrox - live on Sky Sports.\nFans in the away end in Belgium were heard calling for him to depart the club after just 84 days in charge.\n\nThe club's Fan Advisory Board have since called for Martin to be replaced, irrespective of Sunday's result against Celtic.\nRangers have won just three of their 10 matches under Martin, who has made the worst start as a permanent Rangers manager.\nThe Ibrox side have drawn all three Scottish Premiership matches, and a defeat on Sunday would leave them nine points adrift of their rivals.\nIt is believed the US ownership group, including chairman Andrew Cavenagh, were already planning to attend the Old Firm match.\nThe result across the two legs is the joint-third biggest margin in Champions League history and also extends his record to just three wins from 10 games at Ibrox - the worst of any manager in the club's history. Yet Martin, who watched as the remaining away supporters called for his sacking at full-time, has no fear of any immediate repercussions.\n\"I have nothing to say but really apologise to the fans that travelled and the fans back home,\" Martin told TNT Sports post-match.\n\"The job of head coach and manager is to make sure it doesn't happen again and respond properly. We didn't respond well enough to an early setback tonight. It shouldn't happen, it's such basics. Now we have to show a big response on Sunday.\n\"Patrick [Stewart] and Kevin [Thelwell], I've had a chat with them already, they're amazingly supportive. They knew this would take time, they understand the club's position.\"\nMartin would also go on to continue his rhetoric about a lack of commitment from certain players, a sentiment he also ushered following the 1-1 draw with St Mirren that saw Hamza Igamane allegedly refuse to come off the bench.\n\"There's not enough harmony or care for each other quite yet. But I knew that coming in, we have to build that, heal and get stronger through it,\" he said.\n\"There aren't enough players who want to fight for each other and the club yet. The window shuts on Monday. The harmony has been disrupted.\n\"I'm not talking about individual players, I'm talking about the group as a whole. The harmony of us. It's not an excuse, we need to be much better.\n\"For us, it really hurts, it's really humiliating tonight and we have to make sure we respond in the right way on Sunday.\"\nThe Rangers Fan Advisory Board have called on the Ibrox club to replace Martin.\nIn a statement, they said, \"irrespective of the result on Sunday, it is clear to us the manager should be replaced as a matter of urgency before our justified anger gives way to apathy\".\nThey added \"the board must commit to a new manager who understands and accepts the standards that have been set by our successful teams in the past - and can deliver on them\".\nIn November 2023, Rangers announced the establishment of the Fan Advisory Board and confirmed they would meet \"at regular intervals with senior club management\".\nRangers' statement at the time added that the Fan Advisory Board would \"play a crucial role in shaping the future of Rangers FC, providing vital input and guidance on key club matters and policies\".\n\nSky Sports' Kris Boyd following his former side's 6-0 defeat to Club Brugge:\n\"There will be an investigation into this. So bad, so, so bad. It looks like a group that has absolutely chucked it.\n\"Inside just weeks of a new manager coming in, it's worrying.\n\"I know a few people said - myself included - that Russell Martin wouldn't lose his job off the back of a Champions League defeat. Because there's no disgrace in losing to Club Brugge.\n\"But the way Rangers have lost - there will be a lot of Rangers fans wanting Russell Martin removed.\n\"I don't disagree [that he needs more time]. That's football - but it's totally different in Glasgow. If you're losing 9-1 to a team in the Champions League, it's bad enough.\n\"You can say you're going to be given time - with new owners coming in that's what they will look to do. But you have to see signs of improvement and that's not been the case.\n\"The reality is: you have two huge football clubs domestically, but when they go to Europe, they are shown up for what they are. Both are obsessed with winning domestically.\n\"Celtic had more success than Rangers in recent times. but Celtic have their own issues - their fans are not happy with the board not spending money.\n\"But domestically they will be fine. You wouldn't rule out Celtic winning another treble with the way this Rangers team are. Rangers will be hoping another team - a Hibernian, Hearts or Aberdeen - putting up a fight to stop Celtic winning a cup, because Rangers ain't going to do anything the way things are now.\n\"It is getting worse. That is really impossible to happen inside six or seven weeks into a new season. But Rangers have found a way.\n\"You speak about performances that could get managers the sack - this is heading in that direction. I will struggle to see a way back for Russell Martin after this.\"\nRangers captain James Tavernier refused to outright back Martin when speaking with TNT Sports after the final whistle, but did admit that he and his teammates had to take responsibility for their poor start to the season.\n\"For what we want to do as a team and as a club, we didn't represent the club in any good shape or form there.\n\"We had aspirations to get into the Champions League. We're in the Europa League now but it's still early in the season. But we have to make sure this is the last night or the last game that we feel like this will put in a performance like that.\n\"Myself and the senior boys have had a good chat in the dressing room. We all have to hold our hands up and be responsible.\n\"The gaffer gives us a game plan. But you look at the goals that we conceded. We all have to be responsible individually and collectively.\n\"We can't concede easy goals like that. We have to showcase and prove to the manager and to the fans that we belong on the pitch. We didn't do that tonight.\"\nThe Rangers Fan Advisory Board (FAB) has called on the Ibrox club to replace Martin .\nIn a statement, the FAB said: \"Irrespective of the result on Sunday, it is clear to us the manager should be replaced as a matter of urgency before our justified anger gives way to apathy.\n\"The board must commit to a new manager who understands and accepts the standards that have been set by our successful teams in the past - and can deliver on them\".\nIn November 2023, Rangers announced the establishment of the FAB and confirmed they would meet \"at regular intervals with senior club management\".\nRangers' statement at the time added that the FAB would \"play a crucial role in shaping the future of Rangers FC, providing vital input and guidance on key club matters and policies\".",

        "title": "Ruben Amorim's Man Utd crisis after Grimsby Town defeat: What next after miserable start to the new season?",
        "content": "A new low? Quite possibly. Defeat to fourth-tier opposition for the first time in the club's long and storied history, to use a Ruben Amorim phrase, speaks loudly. Manchester United are at another crisis point just three winless games into the new season.\nThose at the top had hoped the nadir was behind them. Omar Berrada, United's chief executive, had said as much. \"As of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us.\" He had praised the \"very clear identity\" of Amorim, talked of a long-term vision.\nSir Jim Ratcliffe had proclaimed that the Portuguese was doing \"a great job\" in March and complained that everyone was expecting miracles. United supporters would settle for avoiding humiliation at Grimsby. The FA Cup is the only hope now. And this is August.\n\nThere will be plenty persuaded by the argument that Amorim needs more time, that part of the problem at United over the dozen years of discontent since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure is that the club has been unable to stick to a plan, to see an idea through.\nThere is logic to that thinking, particularly when the club has committed to this course enough to be dispensing with homegrown talents who do not fit Amorim's system. What sense in reshaping formation and club only to abandon the project so swiftly?\nThe last vestiges of the previous regime are only just being swept away. Remember that image of Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho perched on the hoardings? The poster boys of the FA Cup victory last year on the periphery now.\nThe dangers of flitting from one idea to the next are oft-discussed. Marcus Rashford might be the best or worst placed to comment depending on your view but he articulated the issue well in a recent interview. \"You end up in no-man's land,\" he said.\nThe awkward issue for United's decision-makers is that the argument for continuity only makes sense if the man in whom this faith is placed still believes. The most worrying aspect of events at Blundell Park was the behaviour of the coach upon whom this rests.\n\nThere was the sight of him shuffling his tactics board with his team two down to Grimsby. There was the spectacle of him steering clear of his own players before the penalty shoot-out and then being slumped in the dugout refusing to watch once it began.\nThe memes are one thing but more significant were the words that followed. \"Something has to change,\" said Amorim in the aftermath of defeat. \"And you are not going to change 22 players again.\" This from a coach who has offered to leave before.\n\"I have nothing to say. That is the biggest problem.\" Indeed. Because there has been enough change of personnel on the pitch for Amorim to be beginning to take control of this situation by now. He finished the game with his new £200m forward trio out there.\nBut Matheus Cunha was the first Manchester United player to miss, Bryan Mbeumo was the last. In between, there was the strange sight of Benjamin Sesko, the club's new £74m striker, being the very last outfield player out on the pitch to step up to take one.\nBoth Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu, the latter as a specialist wing-back designed to fit his system, have come in since Amorim's appointment. Manuel Ugarte has worked with him before. More players are needed but it should be functioning better than this.\n\nThe tactical inflexibility that saw Mason Mount deployed at left wing-back will be the focus of a lot of noise externally. But internally, the chief concern of both Amorim and those above him will be that the much-vaunted spirit and harmony has dissipated.\nThat was the message of the summer coming out of the club, that there had been a change of mood to go with the new stadium plans and training-ground revamp. Luke Shaw spoke of the toxic environment of the past. This was a fresh start at United.\n\"Now, I am excited,\" Amorim told Sky Sports just recently.\n\"It is completely different.\"\nThe fragility of that has already been exposed. It survived defeat to Arsenal on the opening weekend because there were some positive signs, but a stuttering draw at Fulham was less convincing and this performance was as miserable as it gets.\n\nAlready, the optimism has been undermined and United finding themselves lurching once more. Just hoping they can navigate a home fixture against Burnley, limp to that international break and take stock once the summer transfer window has closed.\nTime. That is at the heart of this. \"We have a game at the weekend, then we have two weeks and we will solve things.\" But that was what pre-season, Amorim's first, was supposed to do. Manchester City and Chelsea will be waiting for them on their return.\nAnd yet, still there is an appetite for all this to work, for a talented young coach who has lost more games than he has won at Manchester United to come good in the end, for an exciting new team to emerge stronger from this chastening experience.\nThose at the top are certainly invested. The men who saw themselves as part of the clean-up operation risk being seen as adding to the mess.

        "title": "Jess Carter: Man arrested in relation to racist and abusive messages sent to England defender during Euro 2025",
        "content": "A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of malicious communications in relation to some of the racist and abusive messages sent to England international Jess Carter during Euro 2025.\nThe 27-year-old defender revealed during the tournament in Switzerland that she had been subject to racist slurs on her social media accounts since the tournament began.\nThe FA contacted UK police when it was informed of the abuse Carter has been subjected to, and the un-named man from Great Harwood in Lancashire has since been apprehended. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.\nAn investigation was launched by the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) after Carter revealed the scale of the abuse following England's quarter-final win over Sweden.\nCheshire Constabulary chief constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chief Council (NPCC) lead for football policing, said: \"The messages directed towards Jess Carter were appalling and I would like to commend her for standing up to this abuse and assisting with our investigation.\n\"Nobody should be subjected to such disgusting abuse, and I expect that today's arrest will be the first of many over the coming months.\n\"We want to make it clear that racist abuse of this nature will not be tolerated. Everyone is responsible for what they do and say, and we want to ensure offenders cannot hide behind a social media profile to post vile comments.\"\nAt the time of Carter's public statement, tributes poured in from far and wide including from her Lionesses team-mates and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nResearch from SentientSports GuardianAI went on to find that Carter had been the player targeted with the most negativity on social media during the penalty shoot-out win over Sweden, with 9.8 per cent of abusive posts aimed at her.\nOn the back of the abuse, the Lionesses collectively decided to stop taking a knee ahead of matches during the tournament.\nIn her initial statement on July 21, Carter said: \"From the start of the tournament I have experienced a lot of racial abuse. Whilst I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don't agree or think it's ok to target someone's appearance or race.\n\"As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.\n\"As ever I am grateful for all of the support from the genuine fans but I am taking this measure to protect myself in a bid to keep my focus on helping the team anyway I can. Hopefully speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so that others won't have to deal with it.\n\"We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all. I'm now looking forward and focusing on putting all of my energy into helping my team.\"\nEngland went on to lift the Euro 2025 trophy in Switzerland, with Carter starting and playing the whole game of the final penalty shoot-out win over Spain.",

        "title": "Dominik Szoboszlai indispensable to Arne Slot at Liverpool, Graham Potter's big issue at West Ham - The Radar",
        "content": "\nWelcome to The Radar , a Sky Sports column in which Nick Wright uses a blend of data and opinion to shed light on need-to-know stories from up and down the Premier League. This week:\n🔴 Szoboszlai's importance to Slot ⚒️ West Ham's sluggish midfield 💯 Haaland's Man City milestone 🔍 A player to watch this weekend\nDominik Szoboszlai was the only Liverpool player not to touch the ball in the build-up to their winning goal against Newcastle but he still made the most important contribution.\n\n\"That, for me, should go down as an assist,\" said Thierry Henry on Monday Night Football of the dummy that allowed Mohamed Salah's cut-back to run through to the unmarked Rio Ngumoha.\nIt was typical of Szoboszlai in its selflessness. The 24-year-old had been pushed into midfield by that point in the game but he had spent the rest of it at right-back, called into action in a position in which he had never previously played a competitive fixture.\nIt was a daunting assignment in the cauldron of St James' Park, up against the pace of Harvey Barnes. But the Newcastle winger was substituted in the second half having been nullified, not registering a shot or even completing a dribble up against Szoboszlai.\n\"He was absolutely outstanding in this game,\" said Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher. Liverpool are likely to have Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez available again against Arsenal on Sunday but Slot now knows he has another option. Szoboszlai continues to show his worth.\nFlorian Wirtz's arrival has increased the competition in Liverpool's midfield but Szoboszlai's versatility and tactical intelligence make him uniquely important. It is not unusual to see him adjusting to different roles within games, adapting to what is required.\nJurgen Klopp described him as \"a joy to work with\" and Slot feels the same way. \"In my opinion, he is a bit underrated, but not by me,\" said the Liverpool boss last season. Slot, like Klopp before him, values his tireless work rate as well as his technical and tactical qualities.\nIt is not just the work he gets through but the manner in which he does it. \"He just keeps on running with the highest intensity,\" added Slot. Szoboszlai is in a league of his own on that front among Liverpool players. According to GeniusIQ , he ranks behind only Anthony Gordon and Dominic Solanke in the Premier League for sprinting pressures since the start of last season.\nIf there is one criticism of Szoboszlai, it is that he could contribute more in terms of end product. But he deserved an assist for Liverpool's winner on Monday, as Henry said, and the value of his unseen work out of possession cannot be underestimated.\n\"That is so important for a team that wants to compete for something,\" added Slot. Szoboszlai will continue to play a vital role.\nNottingham Forest's game against West Ham on Sunday is a meeting of two managers under pressure for different reasons. While politics threaten Nuno Espirito Santo's position, results and performances are the problem for Graham Potter.\n\nLast Friday's 5-1 thrashing by Chelsea felt like a nadir after the 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland on the opening weekend. But the situation went from bad to worse as tensions boiled over during Tuesday's Carabao Cup exit against Wolves.\nPotter now takes his side to the City Ground having won fewer points than his predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, in the same number of games. Only Avram Grant has averaged fewer points per game among West Ham managers in the Premier League era.\nThe numbers are damning but Potter has not been helped by the club's sluggishness in addressing long-standing issues in terms of personnel. A midfield inhibited by a glaring lack of pace continues to be bypassed by opponents all too easily.\nJames Ward-Prowse, Tomas Soucek and Guido Rodriguez, their midfield starters at Molineux, actually rank as some of the Premier League's most industrious players for distance covered. The problem is that they sit at the opposite end of the scale for speed.\nIt is remarkable that a Premier League side's slowest players should be concentrated in central midfield and it is only now, in the final days of the window, that the club are addressing the problem.\nThe incoming Matheus Fernandes will instantly become one of West Ham's quickest players having recorded a top speed of 35.12 km/h for Southampton last season. Soungouto Magassa is also seen as someone who can bring some speed across the ground.\nBut West Ham's lack of pace is not limited to their midfield. Mohammed Kudus and Michail Antonio, two of their quickest attackers, have now departed, with the 33-year-old Callum Wilson, signed on a free transfer, the only attacking recruit so far.\nThe squad's shortcomings were apparent long before this summer. The club's recruitment is rightly under scrutiny. But their under-fire manager must get more out of what he has got too.\nErling Haaland is in line for his 100th Premier League appearance when Manchester City face Brighton on Sunday. Pep Guardiola will hope to see him back among the goals after drawing a blank against Spurs but he will reach the milestone with a record total regardless.\nHis tally of 87 goals from 99 appearances puts him comfortably ahead of any other player in Premier League history at the same point and underlines why so many sides have sought to add their own versions in this summer's transfer window.\nFor Arsenal, Viktor Gyokeres is the chosen one, another low-touch No 9 to add the killer instinct they lacked. Liverpool want Alexander Isak having already added Hugo Ekitike. Manchester United and Newcastle, meanwhile, have targeted strikers with similar physical profiles to Haaland in Benjamin Sesko and Nick Woltemade. So too, in fact, have Brighton, in Greek youngster Charalampos Kostoulas.\nHaaland has brought the No 9 back into fashion.\nOn a packed Super Sunday , Brighton vs Manchester City , Nottingham Forest vs West Ham, Liverpool vs Arsenal and Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace are all available to watch on Sky Sports .\nBryan Mbeumo had a night to forget against Grimsby in midweek but his running power was the focus of last week's column. Matt O'Riley also featured as he fills the Joao Pedro role for Brighton.\nStarting this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season will be shown live on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Manchester United's attitude stinks and Ruben Amorim could walk if they don't beat Burnley, Paul Merson says",
        "content": "Manchester United are arguably at their lowest ebb after an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town.\nRuben Amorim's side were very much second-best against their fourth-tier opponents, falling 2-0 down at half-time. And while Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire rescued a 2-2 draw, they then crashed out after a marathon penalty shoot-out.\nAfter the game Amorim made some concerning comments, insisting his players \"spoke really loud to him\" and that \"something has to change\" - but adding he cannot change 22 players again.\n\nSo what now for Man Utd? Sky Sports' Paul Merson gives his verdict on their plight. Read the Magic Man's comments below...\nI watched the whole game and all the way through to the penalties and: hard work. You have to put in the hard work. You could be some of the most talented players in the world but you have to work hard.\nNo disrespect to Grimsby, they shouldn't be on the same pitch as Man Utd. If Man Utd turn up with the attitude Grimsby had, there's only one result and everyone would have been turning over at half-time, looking for something else to watch. That wasn't the case.\nHalf of them turned up thinking: 'I'm only playing because it's Grimsby. I won't be playing against Burnley on Saturday'. Instead of: 'When I walk off that game, those Grimsby fans and players will go: I didn't know he was that good.' That's not the case.\nThe attitude stinks from half of them. Back in the day, there were shocks, the pitches were a joke. That pitch was immaculate and they should go out and destroy Grimsby.\nCristiano Ronaldo doesn't get to the top by just his talent. And if he has to work hard as one of the greatest players of all-time, why can't the Manchester United players? It's arrogance.\nWho can knock on the door this weekend and go: why am I not playing? And they all want to leave! Where are they going to go? Who's going to take them?\n\nWhen he said: my players talk really loud - that means he has seen enough to know that they're not really playing for him, in my opinion.\nThen he turned around and said 'I can't change all 22 players', [meaning] 'it will have to be me to leave'.\nI was a manager at Walsall. You just know, and you get a feeling, when things aren't right.\nWhen Amorim came in everybody knew he could play three at the back. Everybody knew. Man Utd knew. The owners knew.\nHe got that job by going the way he played. They never had the players to play that way - ever.\nI could have seen him go in at Chelsea with Malo Gusto, Reece James - attacking wing-backs who can make things happen and cross the ball. They're up and down. Chelsea have three centre-backs who would have suited the way he played.\nThey got the wrong man for the players they had. He had to change the whole lot. They're not going to do that and he's not going to change his system for Man Utd.\nHe came in from Portugal to one of the biggest jobs in world football playing the way he played. Why would he change?\nHe didn't want to come in during the middle of the season because he knew they were not his players. No wing-backs. Then he had to come in, it was a mad struggle and this season he hasn't got it.\nAmorim has probably just gone: 'I just have to outscore teams', with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko up front. Bruno Fernandes playing as well. And I don't think he'll do that.\n\nI will be shocked if he's still in charge if Man Utd don't beat Burnley. But they will beat Burnley! It's a nice game.\nErik ten Hag had that as well: three or four games without a win and then second-bottom of the league came. They just won that game and then lost three or four games again.\nIt's just going to keep on covering the cracks. They will be called Pollyfilla United!\nI don't think Amorim will be shy to go: 'I've had enough. I can't do anything. I've done what I can'.\nI don't think he is one to put himself through pain to get his pay-off. I don't know the man, but [the way he is] coming across, I think he's an honest man and will be honest with himself. But I think they will beat Burnley.\n\nFor me, I would have said yes. You don't win league titles, World Cups or European Championships without good goalkeepers.\nOnana doesn't save points, the goalkeepers lose points at Man Utd. So as soon as you lose points, that's a worry.\nThey need a new goalkeeper. I see Gianluigi Donnarumma's around - why don't they go for him? But again, they've used their money in other positions.\nThey need legs in midfield. No one has ever won a tournament or league without legs in midfield.\n\nThey bought Sesko for £70m and he's taking the 10th penalty? I thought he had a broken leg when he stepped up. I thought he must be that injured that he's taking the 10th penalty.\nAnd then I heard people saying that he didn't want to miss or take that pressure. He's a £70m player! He's coming to score goals for Man Utd to take them back to where they should belong and he's taking the 10th penalty?\nHe has to be in the top five. He's taking a penalty from 12 yards and the goalkeeper can't come off his line!\nI forgot that he was playing and then when he stepped up for the 10th penalty... wow.",

This was a snapshot of hope, an image to believe better times were ahead.\nHojlund was in the hot streak of his Man Utd career, in the midst of a run which saw him bag seven goals in six games.\nGarnacho recorded his best figures for goal involvements that season, scoring seven in the Premier League - including that Puskás winner at Everton - and the opener in the FA Cup final win over Man City.\nMainoo also netted at Wembley, seemingly confirming his rise would inevitably take him to the top.\nSitting down with then-United boss Erik ten Hag in the days after the Old Trafford photo was taken, the Dutchman sounded a warning to the trio.\nHe spoke of having to match \"high potentials\" with high performances. \"They are the next steps, which have to come,\" he told Sky Sports .\nBut unquestionably the feeling at that point was optimism. \"We have some exciting players,\" said Ten Hag, when he was asked about the celebration. There was a smile from a manager who is typically more interested in tactical talk than emotions.\nHe could see the importance of the symbolism and also what it meant to Man Utd supporters.\nAfter all, this is a club which prides itself on its history of developing and honing young talents.\nYet, fast forward to the final days of this summer's transfer window and Hojlund is off to Napoli, Garnacho to Chelsea and Mainoo - that prized, homegrown asset - can't get in the first team, has requested a loan and is expected to be the subject of offers from elsewhere.\nMainoo and Garnacho, in particular, feel victims of circumstance - and Ruben Amorim's fixation on 3-4-3.\n\nThe Englishman isn't trusted in the central midfield two - despite playing a similar role alongside Declan Rice at the Euros. Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte are favoured there.\nHe got a runout in the disastrous defeat to Grimsby but it is clear Amorim isn't convinced he has the attributes for the position.\nA short-lived experiment to play Mainoo off the striker seems over too, with United spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With Fernandes also deployed in that more advanced role, Mainoo, again, could count him fourth-choice in another position.\n\nGarnacho, meanwhile, finds himself a winger for a team which no longer uses them - and a wing-back role never looked like a conversion to maximise his talents.\nThere have been strops at substitutions and friction off the field but attitude is not a core reason for his exit.\nFor Hojlund, too many misses have ultimately been his undoing, with Benjamin Sesko now signed to lead the line. However, he could justifiably point to a far from fully-functioning attack around him.\nAnd there should also be sympathy for a young forward who was never intended to carry the weight of being United's lead striker, having arrived in a summer when they intended to also go for Harry Kane.\nInterestingly, Hojlund had more goals than Kane when he turned 22 but United want to move on.\nIt is not hard to imagine this trio following Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Antony in rejuvenating their careers away from Old Trafford.\nThey are all talented and will surely enjoy good times again. And that will raise more questions about the environment and culture at United - and perhaps, down the line, regrets.\nWhere, for instance, will Mainoo be in a couple of years time, when Fernandes, Casemiro and Ugarte will likely have departed?\nWould Amorim's successor - whether he arrives sooner or later - not wish to have a winger with Garnacho's threat?\nThe pair could be jettisoned in favour of the ideas of a head coach with the worst Man Utd managerial record in the modern era.\nIt has been the story of United since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement: veering from one direction to another with little thought of the long-term plan.\nHojlund, Garnacho and Mainoo looked set to be the future when they were pictured together on that promising day at Old Trafford. Just 16 months on they are out of the frame.",

        "title": "Eberechi Eze: Can Arsenal's new No 10 help end the Gunners' long wait for a Premier League title?",
        "content": "Eberechi Eze's journey to becoming an Arsenal player was one that began with the tears of a 13-year-old and one that culminated in an on-pitch unveiling at the Emirates.\nFor a sum of £67.5m, Arsenal signed a player they let go from their academy over a decade ago. When he found out he would be released by Arsenal as a youngster, Eze recalls having to train while crying throughout the session as his dream of representing the Gunners was crushed.\nHaving sat down with Eze in May, after his FA Cup heroics clinched Crystal Palace's first major honour, it was clear that faith and a family-borne resilience kept him going.\nIt wasn't the only setback a young Eze had to face. Fulham, Reading, and Millwall also overlooked him, unable to unlock and foresee the talents of the now England international as the 27-year-old was forced to take the long way home.\n\nQueens Park Rangers offered Eze an opportunity, before Crystal Palace took a punt on one of the Championship's finest and provided a stage in the top flight.\nAnd now, after etching his name into folklore at Selhurst Park, the Emirates finally awaits as the redemption arc nears realisation in Arsenal's new-look attack.\nPalace's unlikely yet historic FA Cup triumph confirmed what fans of the club already believed - Eze could be relied upon to lead the club to great things.\nEze himself knew that it would happen. For him, it was only a matter of timing.\n\nOn the day of Palace's trophy parade, he sat with the same confidence he takes to the pitch.\nWhen Eze signed for the club from QPR, he walked into a dressing room that had the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke.\nAll three, in their own right, contribute to a team capable of surviving in the Premier League. Becoming Palace's marquee man formed the basis of any overarching ambition Eze had, but it had to begin with humbly learning from his elders. It was those role models who Eze paid homage to as the foundation of Palace's current success.\n\nThe groundwork was laid for a new Palace player to spearhead the side as they all moved onto pastures new, and it was a mantle Eze picked up with both hands.\nWith Premier League survival continuing to be the Palace's primary goal under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira, Eze initially struggled for consistency, with injuries providing an obstacle.\nHowever, the FA Cup proved to be Eze's coming of age. He spurred Palace on, scoring in both the semi-final and final. The back end to the 2024/25 season saw Eze perform at his very best, displaying a consistency that will have impressed Mikel Arteta and Arsenal.\n\nWhat made Eze a joy to watch was the unpredictability he brought to SE25. It's that x-factor Arsenal have perhaps lacked, coming up short in their attempts to fend off the competition for the Premier League title.\nArsenal have been said to have developed an overreliance on Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, who have proved dependable sources of goals and assists. This is reflected heavily on the pitch with Arsenal's biasing the right-hand side during attacks.\nWhile various patterns born out of this area have unravelled defences and produced key attacks, an obvious foil for opposition defences is to gamble and double up in that area of the pitch.\nAware of this, Arsenal have negotiated means of ensuring Saka remains a threat; however, the predictability in attack means Arteta's free-flowing attacking side of perhaps a couple of seasons ago has become a team commended for their strong foundations, but at times failing to excite in attack.\nAs one of the league's chief creators from his favoured left-hand side, Eze adds a new dynamic to Arsenal attacks. Should Eze fill in on the left, which many have predicted, he'll become another vessel for Arsenal attacks, creating a balance that could unnerve the staunchest of defences.\nIt's also important to note, though, that at Palace, Eze was seldom used as a traditional touchline winger. In Glasner's system, he was what's best described as a 'left 10' when in possession. As a left 10, Eze offers Arsenal what they don't have in any of their current options off the left.\nIn attack, Eze's athleticism, along with his desire to get and stay on the ball and operate primarily in the half space, frees up further opportunities for a left-back to maraud forward to create overloads. But his distinct confidence on the ball means beating players one-on-one is also an option.\nDefensively, the discipline of Glasner's 3-4-2-1 will have readied Eze for the demands of Arteta's fluid 4-3-3. As with his Austrian counterpart, a willingness to take up defensive positions off the ball, cover space and support your full-back are among Arteta's non-negotiables. Eze fits that bill too, as one of last season's leading attacking players when it came to winning the ball back in the defensive and middle third of the pitch.\nThe redemption story to this point appears far too perfect for Eze's story to close with simply signing a deal at Arsenal. Rejection was just the beginning with Eze deliberately navigating himself back to where he felt he belonged.\nHe said he'd do \"anything possible to win the Premier League\" back in May. The FA Cup win just whetted his appetite for more.\nThe Emirates is primed and ready for Arsenal's new No 10. But whether he will be the difference maker in Arteta's long-awaited hunt for a league title remains to be seen.",

All was fine. Trained fine yesterday [Saturday], warmed up fine. I turned around to him at 60 minutes because I wanted two strikers on the pitch.

That is not going to change.\n\"The players not playing with be disappointed but everyone will have opportunities. You have to fight in the week.\"\nAsked about the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who is nearing a move to Napoli on an initial loan deal, Amorim said: \"Until it is official, I cannot say much.\"",

I now can't be influenced or swayed by outside noise.\n\"Also, when you grow up and have to experience many tough things you realise a bit of perspective and gratitude that means actually, this is football.\n\"It means so much for everyone, but there's a lot of tougher things to endure. Now we have to make sure that we win as many games as we can.\"\nRangers have won three of their 10 matches under Martin, who has made the worst start as a permanent manager at the club.\nHis side have drawn all three Scottish Premiership matches, and a defeat on Sunday would leave them nine points adrift of their rivals.\nAsked if Sunday's game against Celtic had extra significance given Rangers' start to the season, he added: \"This game is always going to be important for anyone.\n\"The manner of defeat makes everything feel terrible. We've qualified for Europa League, we have a chance to put things right on Sunday.\n\"I think the noise is the loudest I've ever had to deal with as a coach or a player, but you have to accept that being here and I knew it was going to be the case.\n\"That is what it is. It doesn't affect the work. We have to be really driven and focused on Sunday now and it's really as simple as that.\"\n\nMartin has insisted there has not been a breakdown in his relationship with Nico Raskin, amid speculation he could leave the club before Monday's transfer deadline.\nThe Belgium international did not start against Club Brugge but has trained ahead of Sunday's game.\n\"Everyone's here, everyone's available, and the squad and the team will be picked on what we think is the best way to win the game,\" the former Southampton boss added.\n\"Nico is in training today.\n\"The whole squad is here, things can change, transfer window's open, so I can't tell you anyone's going to definitely be in the squad or not.\nAsked if there has been a breakdown in his relationship with Raskin, he added: \"I'd describe my relationship with all the players, all the staff as honest, open. I don't think you can have anything else apart from that,\"\n\"There's not a breakdown in any relationships here. If it's honest and open, there can't be a breakdown in any relationships.\"",

However, if there's an opportunity there where a deal suits all parties and there's something that can come in that I'm happy with then of course, we have to look at it.\n\"Yang's been a really good squad player for us over the last couple of years and sometimes the challenge for someone who probably maybe sees themselves as a squad player is that, after a couple of years, they then feel that need and want to move on.\n\"I totally understand that and I think the situation with Yang, that's been ongoing for a while now.\n\"However, because of where we're at within the squad, then there was no way that we could let Yang go. I know that if he stays here, Yang, he plays a really important contribution for us in the squad throughout all the games that we'll play.\"\n\nCeltic are set to confirm the signing of Uruguayan left-back Marcelo Saracchi from Boca Juniors after the 27-year-old trained at Lennoxtown ahead of Sunday's Old Firm game, live on Sky Sports .\nBelgian winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha, whose transfer from Royal Antwerp was announced by Celtic on Thursday, also trained and the 24-year-old could make his debut against Rangers.\nThe additions come after the Hoops lost to Kairat Almaty on penalties in their Champions League play-off, and Rodgers is keen for Celtic to avoid that situation again.\n\"The club's so well run, with the board, with Dermot, it's been that way for many years. Obviously we sell players, we make a lot of money, but we also put money in as well. So the investment's there,\" the Irishman added.\n\"The big thing we need to look at is the timing of investment.\n\"I always think that's really important because that's something I felt that we could have had, maybe, leading into the game, then it would certainly give us a better possibility.\n\"But it hasn't happened and we need to understand why that is, and what the sources of that are, that can help us be better in the future as a football club. That's my take on it.\"",

        "title": "Bukayo Saka's hamstring injuries a big concern, says Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta",
        "content": "Mikel Arteta has admitted Bukayo Saka's hamstring injuries are a big concern as Arsenal prepare to face champions Liverpool without their talisman on Super Sunday .\nSaka, who missed a three-month period of last season due to an injury to his right hamstring, was forced off after feeling something in his left hamstring during Arsenal's 5-0 win over Leeds.\nThe 23-year-old has avoided the need for surgery on this occasion, with the injury not as bad as first feared, but he will play no part at Anfield and has also been omitted from the England squad.\n\"Bukayo is doing better but he is out for a few weeks unfortunately,\" said Arteta at his press conference on Friday.\n\"No surgery. It's not as bad as the previous one. Obviously it's very unfortunate to pick it up but it's on the other side.\n\"It's an action that requires full power from him. He felt something, so he will be out for a couple of weeks.\n\"Let's see how he evolves in the next few days and weeks, repeat the scan and see where he's at.\"\nAsked if Saka's second hamstring injury in under a year was a big concern, Arteta said: \"Yes it is a big one, especially when we talk about a sprinter, a player who gets into that zone very often, who needs that burst, that change of pace to be threatening.\n\n\"We will learn again why it happened and make him stronger, but unfortunately injuries are part of your career.\n\"He hasn't had that many, with the amount of games he has played, but it's something we want to eradicate.\"\nSaka was not the only player forced off against Leeds, with captain Martin Odegaard having to be withdrawn after landing awkwardly on his shoulder.\nOdegaard has, though, been called up for Norway's upcoming games and Arteta said he is pushing hard to be fit against Liverpool.\n\"We don't know yet. He hasn't trained yet and if he does it will be tomorrow. Let's see.\n\"He is doing everything he can. We are doing everything we can to make him available. But we have to wait and see tomorrow.\n\"There is an injury there but hopefully, if everything goes well, he can cope with it.\"\nOne player who will definitely join Saka on the sidelines against Liverpool is Kai Havertz , who has had to undergo surgery to fix a knee injury which the club hope will only keep him out for weeks rather than months.\n\"Very unfortunate, very sad for him,\" said Arteta. \"I think he did tremendously well to recover from the previous one. He had never had an injury before.\n\"And then this happens. But it's part of football. We need to live with that. Obviously we lose another big player for many, many weeks but [surgery] was the right thing to do.\n\"The doctors advised it and he was very convinced at the end that it was the quickest and best way to resolve the issue.\"\nArsenal's injuries open the door for new signing Eberechi Eze to make his debut at Anfield.\nThe forward was unveiled at the Emirates Stadium ahead of the game against Leeds and has already made a positive impression on Arteta in training.\n\n\"Really impressed with him. I heard a lot of things about him, I spoke to a lot of people about him. Really bright, a very special energy and a special aura around him.\n\"He's already gathering a lot of information, the things we want to see on the pitch, but especially [we have to] make sure he has the freedom and capacity to express his quality, which is the reason why we brought him here.\"\n\nAsked what specific qualities he will add to his team, Arteta said: \"First of all his energy. When you are next to him, you are comfortable. He has got a big smile, he asks you the right questions.\n\"And then his flow with the ball, the ability to pick passes, to drive past people effortlessly, and just understand the timing of things. Very impressive.\"\nArsenal will head to Anfield on Sunday aiming for a first Premier League win at the ground since 2012 and Arteta has challenged his players to seize their chance to make a statement about their title credentials.\n\"They are the champions for a reason, because they deserved to be champions,\" he said of Liverpool.\n\"They were the better team last season, the most consistent one, the one that found ways to win in many different ways.\n\"We want to be that team this year and we need to go to Anfield with that spirit and that conviction.\n\n\"You want to continue building the momentum we are in right now. Going to those grounds, against this kind of opposition, is what you want. Coming from those big games winning in a really convincing way, that's the objective.\n\"The favourite is always the one that won in the previous year. Someone has to come and take that crown away from them, and that's what we, the rest, are going to try to do.\n\"We have already started with the first two games in the Premier League, and that's the aim, be better than them.\"\nArsenal will be without long-term absentee Gabriel Jesus in addition to Saka and Havertz, while Christian Norgaard and Ben White are being monitored along with Odegaard.\nIn a separate interview with Sky Sports News , Arteta said he is delighted with Arsenal's summer transfer business so far and added that sporting director Andrea Berta has done a \"fantastic job\" during the window.\nThe Gunners made their seventh signing of the summer when they confirmed the £67.5m arrival of Eze from Crystal Palace and are now in talks over a deal to add Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie.\n\"Very happy,\" Arteta told Sky Sports News . \"A lot has happened during the summer. Obviously, we were losing some big players as well. A few players were still injured for a long time.\n\"So, I really liked what we've done. The type of characters, personalities we have recruited, the way we have increased the quality and the depth of the squad at the same time, and the way especially they have connected and collaborated with the team.\n\"I think it was [a time to refresh]. I think as well the demands that we are putting on those players, the standards, and the demands that we have now as a football club, as a team.\n\"So, we required this and, as I said, we acted. The club was very aggressive, very determined. Andrea has done a fantastic job there with his team and I'm very, very glad with the outcome.\"",

        "content": "Tottenham have completed the signing of Chelsea target Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £51m.\nThe 22-year-old had been of interest to Chelsea all summer, but Spurs swiftly moved ahead of their London rivals to complete a deal for Simons.\n\"Noise? Don't listen to it all, only what matters. Tottenham called and I answered,\" Simons said in his announcement video, seemingly in reference to links to Chelsea.\n\n\nSky Sports News understands the Netherlands international has signed an initial five-year deal plus two optional years\nSimons is expected to be presented to the Spurs fans ahead of Saturday's Premier League home game against Bournemouth.\nChelsea decided not to bid for Simons due to having other targets, as they look to complete a £40m deal for Alejandro Garnacho , while their valuation of Simons was £43.3m (€50m) to £47.6m (€55m).\n\nSimons' arrival at Tottenham ends their hunt for a new 'No 10', having frustratingly missed out on previous targets.\n\nSpurs failed in their pursuit of Nottingham Forest captain Morgan Gibbs-White earlier this summer, before north London rivals Arsenal hijacked their move for Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze .\nThe capture of the versatile Simons, though, will be of great relief to boss Thomas Frank, who lost James Maddison to a serious knee injury at the start of August, which will sideline the England international for the majority of this season.\nSimons, who had also been of interest to Bayern Munich, becomes Spurs' seventh summer signing to take their spending past £170m.\nSky Sports News understands signing a left-winger is still a target for Spurs in the final days of the window.\nSimons revealed how talks with boss Thomas Frank were key in his move.\nHe told the club's official website: \"I'm really happy and can't wait to get going. I've been dreaming of this for a long time.\n\"It's a great club and when I met the head coach I knew straight away that this was the right place for me.\n\"I will bring flair to the team, but also hard work and discipline. I want to do everything I can to win, for the team and also for the fans.\"\nSimons will wear ex-captain Heung-Min Son's No 7 shirt at Spurs after the forward left the club this summer to join LAFC.\n\"The year at PSV, (7) was the number that I had,\" Simons said. \"I had a really good season as well and the national team I’m number seven as well, so for me this was the best option.\n“He [Son] made his own story with this number. I think he deserves it as well. The way people treat him in the club, not only in the club but the fans as well, they love him. Everyone loves Son.\n“Hopefully I can make my own story with it. I know it’s a big responsibility, but I’m ready to take it and ready to make my own story!\"\n\nA product of Barcelona’s La Masia academy, Simons moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 2019 as a teenager before he made headlines during a productive loan spell at PSV in the 2022/23 campaign.\nSimons would spend the next two seasons at Leipzig, scoring 22 goals in 78 appearances before his move was made permanent earlier this year.\nFrank said: \"I’m really pleased we have brought Xavi in - he is a great addition to the squad.\n\"He is still young, however, he already has good experience and, over the past few years, has played a lot of games at the top level.\n\"Xavi has proven his ability to get goals and assists, both from the No 10 position and left-wing. He also has a great eye for his team-mates in terms of unlocking defences, and I know he will come in and be part of a good team that is already working hard together.”\nSimons moving to Tottenham represents an exciting addition to the Premier League. This is a player long regarded as one of the top young talents in Europe – and he showed glimpses of that ability despite it being a more difficult season for RB Leipzig.\nThere are those top-line numbers. Ten goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga, even as Leipzig missed out on Europe for the first time since their elevation to the top division. He ranked in the top 10 for goals from open play and big chances created.\nBut it was another statistic, the fact that Simons also ranked among the top 10 players for possession won in the final third, that really cuts to the heart of what can make him so good.\nIt is why Simons remains so attractive. Thomas Frank and Tottenham have been eyeing a No 10 all summer, pursuing Morgan Gibbs-White even before James Maddison suffered a serious injury. They have energy in midfield but combining that with craft is the key.\nThere are some gifted players around, individuals able to provide that spark, but finding those capable of doing the work out of possession, playing at high intensity, is difficult. They are at a premium. Simons has demonstrated that ability from the outset.\nRead Adam Bate's feature on Spurs' new signing here.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Celtic have signed left-back Marcelo Saracchi from Boca Juniors on a season-long loan.\nThe 27-year-old makes the move from Argentina as Celtic's ninth addition of the summer, but Sky Sports News understands there is no option to buy in the deal.\nSaracchi, who has nine caps for Uruguay, will provide back-up for Kieran Tierney, which could allow Hayato Inamura to go out on loan.\nHis career started at Danubio in Uruguay before joining River Plate in 2017. After a season, he moved to Bundesliga club RB Leipzig but only made 27 appearances in three years before being loaned to Turkish side Galatasaray during the 2020/21 season.\nThe left-back joined Levante in Spain before heading back to South America with Boca Juniors.\nSaracchi told Celtic TV : \"I'm delighted to be here. I've met all the boys and my overriding emotion is just of excitement and I can't wait to get started.\n\"I've known for a little while that I was coming so there's a lot of excitement there and I can't wait to get started, get out and get playing, and I'm looking forward to it.\n\"I remember the fans at Celtic Park. They were amazing and the stadium had a great atmosphere.\n\"The pressure of playing for a big club is something that I thrive on. It doesn't hinder me, it's the opposite. I look forward to it and I think it pushes me to be better.\"\n\nSouth American football expert Tim Vickery on Sky Sports News:\n\"He's a stocky little left-back, very, very quick. When he first came through, I had immense hopes for this player, real hopes.\n\"I thought he was the future of Uruguay at left-back, and I thought he was on for a brilliant career. So far, it's proved a little bit of a disappointment.\n\"He's been through Germany without doing a great deal, Turkey a little bit more, a little bit in Spain, and then back to Argentina. So he's bounced around.\n\"I think what he perhaps needs in his career is a bit of stability.\n\"As an attacking left-back, I think there's plenty that Celtic can get out of him, especially because he's clearly in a league where Celtic are going to be on the front foot for the vast majority of the time.\n\"So hopefully, this can be the move where Saracchi finally unlocks that potential that I saw a few years ago, but hasn't really come out so far.\"\nKieran Tierney's return to Parkhead was the first confirmed summer transfer, after the defender agreed a pre-contract with his boyhood club.\nMeanwhile, goalkeeper Ross Doohan is also back at the Hoops on a three-year deal after leaving Aberdeen.\nCeltic then added Benjamin Nygren from FC Nordsjaelland in a deal worth around £2m, with the winger signing a five-year deal.\nDefender Hayato Inamura has joined from Albirex Niigata , while Shin Yamada has moved from J-League side Kawasaki Frontale - both on four-year deals.\nJahmai Simpson-Pusey agreed a season-long loan from Manchester City, with the club also securing the signing of teenage forward Callum Osmand on a free from Fulham.\nMichel-Ange Balikwisha became the eighth addition, joining from Royal Antwerp for £5m on a five-year deal.",

They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.\nKobbie Mainoo has requested a loan move to get more game time this season, Sky Sports News has been told.\nBut United have no intention of allowing him to go on loan and Ruben Amorim insisted on Friday that he wants the 20-year-old to stay.\nAmorim said: \"I want Kobbie to stay and he needs to fight for his place.

        "content": "Chelsea are set to beat other Premier League clubs to the loan signing of Facundo Buonanotte from Brighton.\nThe Blues are close to completing the season-long loan signing of the 20-year-old in a deal that does not include an option or an obligation to buy.\n\nThere was interest in Buonanotte from other Premier League clubs, including Leeds United.\n\nBrighton have insisted they only want to loan the Argentina international to a club in England.\nBorussia Dortmund had made a loan offer for the player with an option, while there was also interest from French outfit Lyon.\n\nBuonanotte would be the latest Brighton player - or member of staff - to make the move to Chelsea since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's takeover at Stamford Bridge in 2022.\nBuonanotte would be reunited with former Seagulls team-mates Marc Cucurella, Robert Sanchez, Moises Caicedo and Joao Pedro at Stamford Bridge.\nThe club have also taken a string of staff members, including former boss Graham Potter and recruitment specialists Kyle McAuley, who has since joined Potter at West Ham, and Sam Jewell and Paul Winstanley.\nIncluding the cost of Potter's appointment, Chelsea have spent more than £287m on bringing players and staff in from Brighton, with chief executive Paul Barber joking at the club's fans' forum recently that Chelsea are his \"best customers\".\nChelsea's pursuit of Buonanotte follows an attempt to sign Julio Enciso by Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg, although that move appears to have stalled due to an injury to the Paraguay international.\nBuonanotte has scored five goals in 50 games for Brighton since his arrival from Rosario Central in 2023. He spent last season on loan at Leicester, where he scored six goals in 35 appearances.\nHe can play on the right flank or at No 10 and would become Chelsea's ninth signing of the summer transfer window.",

        "title": "Unai Emery interview: Aston Villa head coach on trying to compete with the richest clubs and why he will do it his way",
        "content": "Perspective is needed at Aston Villa after defeat to Brentford followed a goalless draw at home to Newcastle. It means Villa have failed to score in their first two games for the first time in over 20 years. They are the only one of the 92 clubs yet to score.\nVilla supporters have been left frustrated by a summer in which spending has been restricted and Jacob Ramsey, one of their own, has left for Newcastle. Amadou Onana has now joined Boubacar Kamara on the injury list for Sunday's game against Crystal Palace.\nEmery shares that frustration, of course, describing the club's start as \"poor\" but there is plenty of pride too. Villa's unbeaten Premier League home record now extends over a year. Only last season's top three have picked up more points since he came in.\nThat remains astonishing. Not just because of the circumstances of his arrival, with Villa looking lost and languishing near the bottom at the time, but because seven of the starting line-up on the opening weekend, including the entire back four, were here already.\nThe club is transformed. That context is important. \"Before we arrived, they were struggling, they were even in the Championship,\" Emery tells Sky Sports . \"And now, everything happened. Everything we are sharing with them. It has been fantastic.\"\nHe begins to list just some of the achievements. \"I am very excited to play in Europe again. The Europa League is a fantastic opportunity for us.\" That probably goes without saying when Emery has already lifted that particular trophy on four different occasions.\n\"We played in a semi-final last year in the FA Cup and we played in a semi-final two years ago in the Conference League.\" He might have mentioned the small matter of a Champions League quarter-final too, edged out 5-4 on aggregate by Paris Saint-Germain.\nBut is it getting more difficult? That is a question being asked by supporters. They are asking that question of their club, of the Premier League, and of UEFA. Fans want to feel like they are always building towards something. The appetite for progress is constant.\nIncredibly, after a season in which Palace, Newcastle and Tottenham ended long waits for a trophy, Villa are the only club with an average attendance over 40,000 in last season's Premier League not to have won silverware since 2023. Their own wait dates back to 1996.\nEmery himself posed the question in his programme notes ahead of the big kick-off against Newcastle. Referring to the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR), he wrote of 'clubs doing good management, who will never be allowed to dream'.\nAsking him about that and the challenges facing Villa, he is happy to explain. Typically, however, his first thoughts are tactical rather than financial. It is not just that his team needs strengthening, it is that the Premier League continually poses new problems.\nVilla had 76 per cent of the possession away to Brentford but still could not score. The need to find new solutions is evident if they are to continue to outperform the budget and compete with those clubs at the top end of the Premier League table.\n\"For two years, we have competed for the same positions and gone to Europe. The top seven teams are aware of how we are performing and they want to beat us as well. And it is becoming more difficult for us to try to surprise them. Now it is not surprising.\n\"We are facing them and we are playing well and we are getting good results in the league. But of course, the Premier League is very difficult. And there are other teams as well that are trying to get to the same position that we achieved in the last few years.\n\"Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Fulham. There are others as well. Everton and West Ham, they can be close to us as well to be getting a European position, a top 10 position. The Premier League is a challenge for everybody - for clubs, players and coaches.\"\nBehind the scenes at Villa, one suspects there are those who feel it would be fairer if their accomplishments were judged in comparison to these clubs rather than the free-spending heavyweights that Emery has helped to establish Villa alongside at the top.\n\"The most important teams in the Premier League,\" he begins, before reeling the names off. \"They are really spending a lot of money to increase the level of their squad with more big players.\" The inference one takes is that Aston Villa are not in that position.\nWhile Villa's wage bill is significant, they actually have a negative net spend on transfer fees since the winter of Emery's first full season in charge. For context, while their apparent rivals take up the top seven spots on the list, Villa are 84th out of the 92 clubs.\nHow can they grow, how can they continue to compete, in such circumstances? Emery is defiant. \"We have our own way,\" he says.\n\"We have our own way and we are happy.\"\nEven so, a few more players, UEFA wage restrictions permitting, would surely help bolster what is the smallest squad in the Premier League. Emery spoke in his press conference on Friday of involving the academy players but he would like another solution.\n\"We need to add some players in the attacking third,\" he tells Sky Sports . Evann Guessand has come in at least. The flexible forward from Nice is currently adjusting to Emery's specific tactical demands but is expected to be a useful addition to the squad.\n\"He is going to help us in attacking third,\" says Emery of the 24-year-old Ivorian. \"He is versatile. He can play wide. He can play a little bit close to the striker and even as a striker. I think his versatility is very important. He is going to be an important player for us.\"\nThe final hours of the transfer window before Monday's deadline are expected to be busy. \"Maybe I will spend the day here until the last moment,\" he suggests. In truth, it is the only way that he knows. \"My response is to try to work. To work, to work, to work.\"\nHe adds: \"I am very, very motivated. I believe in the players, I believe in how we are, how we are building the team. Being intelligent and being competitive, this is the way we were doing it. And this is the way as well that we have to do it. This is the challenge.\"\nWatch Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace on Super Sunday; kick-off 7pm",

        "title": "Nick Woltemade joins Newcastle: Stuttgart striker signs in club-record £69m deal to increase chances of Alexander Isak exit",
        "content": "Newcastle have signed Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade in a club-record deal of £69m which opens the door for Liverpool to make a British-record bid for Alexander Isak.\nThe Magpies have agreed to pay £64.86m (€75m) plus £4.3m (€5m) in add-ons for the Stuttgart forward, taking the total package just north of £69m and surpassing the £63m they paid for Isak three years ago.\nWoltemade's arrival increases the likelihood of Isak leaving for Liverpool with less than three days left of the transfer window.\nNewcastle have maintained that Isak would only be sold if an adequate replacement was found. However, they will attempt to bring in a second striker before listening to offers from Liverpool.\nLiverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid for Isak rejected earlier in the summer so will have to increase their offer to reach an agreement with Newcastle. Isak is adamant he will not play for his current club again and is yet to feature this season.\nNewcastle have landed Woltemade ahead of Bayern Munich, who had multiple offers rejected for the forward this summer after he scored 17 goals in 33 appearances for Stuttgart.\nWoltemade says Newcastle have \"big plans\" for him.\n\"I'm really happy to be at this amazing club. From the first contact, I felt like the club really wanted me and had big plans for me,\" he said.\n\"It's a big step in my life to leave Germany but everybody has welcomed me so well and it already feels like family. I have a really good feeling from speaking to the head coach that this is the right place for me to find my best level.\n\"I know the stadium from watching games on television - it looks amazing and I know the atmosphere is crazy. I'm really excited to play and start scoring goals here.\"\nAnalysis from Sky Sports' Adam Bate:\nIt was only a matter of days ago that Germany was abuzz with talk of Nick Woltemade making a move to Bayern Munich . On a recent visit to Stuttgart for the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup against the Bundesliga champions, it was Woltemade - not Harry Kane or Luiz Diaz - who was in the spotlight.\nSpeaking to a host of legendary Bundesliga figures about the 23-year-old forward on that trip, the word that kept coming up was 'unconventional'. Woltemade is 6ft 6in tall but is not a typical target man, preferring to roam into wide areas and drop deep.\nHe is even a dribbler, capable of beating opponents with his surprisingly nifty footwork. Cacau, the Brazilian-born Germany international whose goals fired Stuttgart to the Bundesliga title in 2006-07, was particularly fulsome in his praise for Woltemade and his importance to the team.\n\"He is an amazing player,\" Cacau told Sky Sports . \"He can score goals but he can also give assists. And he is a perfect player for Stuttgart, the perfect No 9. He plays very unconventionally because he is tall but he is also technical. Very, very good.\"\nIt is apparent that Newcastle are looking for a physical No 9 who is capable of leading the line. They have wingers who can provide service for such a player. But they want someone who can bring those wingers into play too. Woltemade fits the bill.\n\nBoth Newcastle boss Eddie Howe and Liverpool head coach Arne Slot were asked about Isak and a potential switch for the striker in their pre-match press conferences on Friday.\nAsked if Isak would stay at Newcastle, Howe said: \"It's difficult for me to give you any clarity. I don't know what the future holds in that respect because I'm not dealing with it myself.\n\"I've got no update from what I spoke about the other day. I'm concentrating on trying to bring players to the club.\"\nSlot was equally coy, saying: \"If it's true, Newcastle have signed a new No 9 and that's very nice for Eddie because Anthony Gordon is suspended and Isak has not been training.\n\"As always, we try to sign players who can help us. There's no reason, after the first two games, to complain, to think we need more. But if we can strengthen the squad, we will try to do that if it's for the right money and the right player.\n\"Let's see if we do something and if we can, what we can do.\"\nNewcastle are still trying to sign Yoane Wissa , who has not played for Brentford in the current campaign amid the Magpies' interest. Newcastle have had two bids turned down by the Bees for the striker.\nHowever, Howe's side are unlikely to continue pursuing Jorgen Strand Larsen given his similarities to the 6ft 6in Woltemade. Newcastle also had two offers rejected for the Wolves striker.\nFrom this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games this season are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Premier League predictions and best bets: Trends to point to draw in Liverpool vs Arsenal",
        "content": "Our football betting expert Jones Knows is back to offer his predictions and insight across the Premier League, tipping a 5/1 double.\nThe market is completely overlooking a new strand of Erling Haaland that might be about to explode. His headed goals numbers.\nOf his 87 Premier League strikes, 15 of them have been headers anyway but that metric is going to be on the increase based on City's new stylistic approach in the final third. It was clear from the outset of the game against Wolves that the inclusion of Tijjani Reijnders has added a directness to what City now do.\nCity weren't turning back inside looking for options, they were looking to hit Haaland inside the area with early crosses.\nHaaland is 6ft 4in remember, and built like an Olympic discus thrower - he is suited to this style. He's recorded five headed shots in his two games this season and a headed goal is on the way. Timing is everything so jumping on now at 9/2 with Sky Bet for Haaland to score a header could be a wise move.\nThe matchday before the first international break always hits hard.\nJust as the season is gathering momentum, we're hit with the prospect of England vs Andorra again. Sigh.\nAn interesting betting angle developing in this final matchday before an international break is that the goal average goes up when analysing it against the season average.\nIn the last six seasons on the matchday before the first international break, the goals per game average is at 3.3, from a sample size of 60 games. If you compare that figure to the average goals per game across those six seasons in the Premier League, which is at 2.8, we're seeing 0.5 more goals scored per game in this matchday. A huge difference in a low-scoring sport like football.\nThat makes the over 2.5 goals line of interest here at Evens with Sky Bet. Having watched West Ham in all three of their matches so far this season, Forest could clear this line on their own. The Hammers have conceded 11 goals and there doesn't seem to be any signs of Graham Potter going back to basics to address the clear problem.\nAsk yourself this: would Arne Slot and Mikel Arteta take a draw right now? The answer is yes, isn't it? Categorically.\nThat makes the draw a huge runner from a betting point of view.\nIt's very unusual to have a fixture played before Gameweek four involving two title rivals. Looking at the past trends when looking at this type of fixture played early on in the season, draws are very common.\nThe last five fixtures in the Premier League before Gameweek four to be played between teams that finished that season in the top three all ended in stalemates - the most recent of which was Arsenal's 2-2 with Manchester City last season.\nThe draw here is the bet at 23/10 with Sky Bet. It's the bet of the weekend.\nIf you need some evidence of why Oliver Glasner is such an incredible manager, just look at his record against Unai Emery, who is arguably regarded as the best pound-for-pound manager in Europe.\nGlasner has won four of the last five meetings with Emery with the aggregate score reading a hefty 17-4 in favour of the Austrian.\nEmery just hasn't found a way of breaking down Palace's mid-to-low block and Glasner's tactic of utilising Ismaila Sarr's pace and power has been so dangerous.\nSarr has been phenomenal in these fixtures, registering seven goal involvements in his last three appearances against Villa. That included two goals and an assist in the 3-0 FA Cup semi-final win. He is 2/1 with Sky Bet to either score or assist again.",

Marc is a crucial part.\n\"Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.\n\"He shows in every game that he's focused. If Marc had said 'I want to leave Crystal Palace', it would already have happened weeks ago.\n\"Marc is fully committed to the team, he shows it every third day at the moment... it is my point of view that we need to keep Marc.\"",

United did create 3.54 worth of expected goals from 26 shots as they did put Burnley under significant pressure.\nIn midweek, Amorim fuelled speculation over his future saying \"something had to change\" after their embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby, before later adding he \"sometimes wants to quit - and sometimes wants to stay at Man Utd for the next 20 years\".\nSpeaking after their win over Burnley, he said: \"When they [his players] put the effort, I will always love them.\n\n\"Even when Amad is missing that goal - I love Amad, if he's giving everything.\n\"We need to understand that we always need to be at this level of effort. Because even in the game, we played well in the beginning. I think we struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match is not so perfect and you can feel the players struggle a little bit, even in the second half but the effort was always there.\n\"We tried to put people in the box. We tried to put more people inside the box, not just around the box to play the ball. Some of the things we were doing during the week and spoke about they were doing that and were focused on the game. So that is the most important thing.\"\nAmorim says his side need both Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha to be competitive after admitting his concerns over their respective injuries.\nCunha went straight down the tunnel, midway through the first half, appearing to clutch his hamstring. Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.\nAsked for an injury update, Amorim said: \"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.\"\nUnited goalkeeper Altay Bayindir conceded two goals from Burnley's six shots at goal and was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal after spilling a shot following a long throw-in.\nAndre Onana was at fault for both Grimsby goals in midweek, allowing Charles Vernam's 22nd-minute strike to go through him at his near post before missing his punch at a cross which gave Tyrell Warren a tap-in eight minutes later.\nAmorim has admitted it's difficult to be a Manchester United goalkeeper such is the scrutiny on the club.\n\n\"They are humans. At Manchester United everything is the news. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper and you can see even when I change the goalkeeper these situations happen. We are in that moment. It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.\n\"If you look at the goal, we can defend better the box. We suffered a similar goal against Fulham because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.\n\"These things don't have anything to do with the goalkeeper. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. Players are struggling a little bit with all the things that are happening around the club, that is normal. It's not just the goalkeepers; everybody has to improve.\"\nRuben Amorim speaking to Sky Sports:\n\"Is it really important? In the future, we are going to find out.\n\"These three points, I think, if you look at the game, we should solve the game right in the first half and then control the game. But it's never easy.\n\"We have to try to fight until the last minute, things that we overcomplicate. But for me, the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what happens, we try. During the game, we try in every moment, sometimes playing well, sometimes playing too open, too fast, losing possessions.\n\"But the effort was there.\n\"I think if you look at the first half, we have so many chances to score a goal and then that can help us to control the emotions, the game, to involve the fans.\n\"But we are always doing this and then you have the feeling you can control the game and I think you control it well. But then one throw-in, one set-piece in this moment is really hard for us. But I was shaking my head because sometimes things are really easy.\n\"I don't like to see penalties, but I like to see the image of the fans. But I was just thinking sometimes one moment can change a lot of things.\n\"But in that moment I just was thinking that it's fair to win this game. I was not expecting Bruno to miss two penalties in a row. So I was really confident.\"\nAmorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing Benjamin Sesko returned to the substitutes' bench.\nSesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby, also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.\n\"So he finished the game (against Grimsby) with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.\n\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.\n\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday.\"\nWhen asked if there will be planned talks during the international break regarding his future, Amorim said: 'I'm always talking with the board and I understand the context, the feeling, everything. So I understand that sometimes I say some things.\n\"Again, I will say it again when we have these kinds of moments. Today was a good day, but it was just a win. For me, it's to look at the game, we should have won in a different way.\n\"We should not suffer. And we return a little bit our level against Arsenal, a little bit against Fulham. And today was more or less the same.\"",

        "title": "Alejandro Garnacho joins Chelsea: Man Utd winger leaves club in £40m transfer as Blues spending nears £300m",
        "content": "Chelsea have signed Alejandro Garnacho in a £40m transfer from Manchester United, taking their summer spend to nearly £300m.\nThe 21-year-old winger becomes Chelsea's ninth arrival, joining new attackers Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens, and increases their outlay to £296.8m.\nChelsea, though, have recouped £314.4m in sales with 26 players exiting the club either in permanent transfers or on loan.\nGarnacho has signed a long-term deal at Chelsea and says he is happy to be joining \"the best team in the world\".\n\"I can't wait to get started,\" he told the Chelsea website. \"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"\nA compromise over Garnacho's valuation had to be reached as United valued him at £50m, which was more than Chelsea were prepared to pay.\nUnited negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.\nThe deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate.\n\nGarnacho turned down offers from other clubs because he wanted to move to Chelsea. The winger was told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.\n\nChelsea are pulling out of the Nicolas Jackson loan deal to Bayern Munich.\nBayern have been informed that Chelsea will not be able to proceed with the proposed deal due to an injury to Liam Delap against Fulham.\nThe decision to cancel Jackson's loan was taken after discussions this afternoon between Chelsea's football leadership team and head coach Enzo Maresca.\nThe player is now expected to return to London. He will go straight back into the first-team squad.\nHe has been training with the first-team squad as there was always the possibility he would stay.\nHe signed an extension last September and his contract runs to 2033.\nChelsea have sent Barcelona a £36.6m (€40m) written bid for Fermin Lopez.\nThey are now waiting for a response after submitting the offer on Saturday.\nSky Sports News has been reporting that Chelsea would make an offer if they received any encouragement that a deal was possible.\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\n\"We've reported in the past that Chelsea were considering opening bids of £25m. I know some Manchester United supporters were very angry with those reports.\n\"It's all been sorted out now. It's a £40m fixed fee and United will also retain a 10 per cent sell-on clause for the player.\n\"This is a significant deal for United. They are often criticised for not getting enough for players and not making money from selling players. This is the largest ever sale for a Manchester United academy product.\n\"From United's perspective, they are very, very happy because a £40m fixed fee is a very good deal for them, for a player who didn't really have a future at the club.\"\nSpeaking earlier this summer, United boss Amorim said: \"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out.\n\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.\n\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"\nIn\nJamie Gittens - Dortmund, £51.5m\nJoao Pedro - Brighton, £60m\nLiam Delap - Ipswich, £30m\nJorrel Hato - Ajax, £38.5m\nEstevao Willian - Palmeiras, £29m\nDario Essugo - Sporting, £18.5m\nMamadou Sarr - RC Strasbourg, £12m\nKendry Paez - Independiente del Valle, £17.3m\nAlejandro Garnacho - Manchester United, £40m\nOut\nKendry Paez - Strasbourg, loan\nDjordje Petrovic - Bournemouth, £25m\nBashir Humphreys - Burnley, £10m\nDylan Williams - Burton, undisclosed\nMarcus Bettinelli - Man City, undisclosed\nKepa Arrizabalga - Arsenal, £5m\nTeddy Sharman-Lowe - Bolton, loan\nMathis Amougou - Strasbourg, undisclosed\nZak Sturge - Millwall, undisclosed\nNoni Madueke - Arsenal, £52m\nCaleb Wiley - Watford, loan\nMike Penders - RC Strasbourg, loan\nJoao Felix - Al Nassr, £43.7m\nIshe Samuels-Smith - Strasbourg, £6.9m\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall - Everton, £29m\nMamadou Sarr - Strasbourg, loan\nLeo Castledine - Huddersfield, loan\nLesley Ugochukwu - Burnley, £23m\nMarc Guiu - Sunderland, loan\nArmando Broja - Burnley, £20m\nRenato Veiga - Villarreal, £26m\nCarney Chukwuemeka - Borussia Dortmund, £24m\nAaron Anselmino - Borussia Dortmund, loan\nAlfie Gilchrist - West Brom, £1.2m\nBrodi Hughes - AFC Wimbledon, loan\nChristopher Nkunku - AC Milan, £36m\nThis season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.\nAnd 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games are on Sky Sports .",

        "title": "Jack Grealish stars for Everton, Chelsea go top but have striker issues  - Premier League hits and misses",
        "content": "\n\nGiven that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.\nHe assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.\nBut it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.\nAsked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\" Adam Bate\nSeven points from the opening three games and topping the Premier League table at the close of play on Saturday would bring a smile to the face of most managers.\nBut Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.\nEnzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.\n\nWithin moments of the injury news being confirmed, Sky Sports News reported Chelsea would be pulling out of the deal to send Jackson on loan to Bayern Munich in the wake of Delap's setback.\nThe player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.\nThe start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.\nDifficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.\nJackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red. Patrick Rowe\n\nAmid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.\nHe was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.\nFor a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.\nHis ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.\nUnited have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him. Lewis Jones\n\nThis 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.\nAfter the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.\nOne fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.\nThose wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.\nOn the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.\nA toothless Spurs had just five shots against the Cherries, while Frank's side failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League home game since February 2020.\nHow Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.\nFrank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"\nSpurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this. Declan Olley\nIt would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.\nBut he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.\nThe absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.\n\"We've historically been a really good attacking team and very good chance creation, but it hasn't quite been there,\" Eddie Howe told Sky Sports after the game. \"We're disappointed with that aspect of our play.\"\nAnd that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.\nAnd Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space. Charlotte Marsh\n\nBefore facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.\nAnd he's being proved right.\nIn their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.\nElland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.\nIn fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.\nIf Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good. Charlotte Marsh\n\nInevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.\nAt half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.\nHowever, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.\nFulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.\nBut he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.\nThey battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.\nWhen it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough. Patrick Rowe\n\nWilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.\nEnzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.\nAcross the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.\nDespite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.\nHis work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season. Callum Bishop\nBrentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.\nThe decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.\nBrentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.\nAsked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly. Noah Langford\nOnly West Ham are keeping Wolves off the bottom of the Premier League table and after three defeats from their first three games there is a growing feeling that this could be the season that the club drops back down to the Championship. They are short of quality.\nMatheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.\nPumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.\nThat seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.\nAsked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\" Adam Bate",

        "content": "Newcastle target Yoane Wissa has sensationally demanded to be sold by Brentford before the summer transfer window closes on Monday.\nNewcastle have had multiple offers rejected for Wissa this summer, and the striker has taken to Instagram to reveal his frustrations at a move not materialising as he pushes for a switch to the Magpies before Monday's 7pm deadline.\nBrentford are not commenting on Wissa's bombshell statement.\nSky Sports News has also not seen evidence of the written assurances Wissa speaks of in his statement.\nWissa said: \"Over the past few weeks, there has been increased speculation about my future at Brentford Football Club. As a result, I wanted to speak directly and honestly about exactly where things stand.\n\"I have stayed silent for much of the summer, but with just hours remaining of the transfer window I feel compelled make it clear that I want to leave Brentford. I believe the club are unduly standing in my way despite a series of fair offers throughout the summer.\n\"I have always given 100 per cent for Brentford since the day I signed back in 2021. I am proud of what we have built together and have never taken the opportunity to play for the club for granted.\n\"Brentford fans will always have a special place in my heart. And I have always conducted myself professionally, both on and off the pitch. It has been a privilege to wear this shirt for 149 games and celebrate 49 goals.\n\"Earlier this summer, I held open discussions with the club's senior management, including key directors and the new head coach. I made clear my intention to explore a new challenge.\n\"During these conversations, it was confirmed to me and my representatives that the club would not stand in my way if a reasonable offer was received. This was also put in writing.\n\"Based on this understanding, I sought to find a new club, keeping Brentford informed with full transparency at every step.\n\"I received a formal offer from another Premier League club and communicated I wanted to join. I was under the impression, from all my conversations with Brentford, that there was a mutual agreement to part ways.\n\"Yet as the window comes to an end, the club has now significantly changed its position, going against what was communicated. This has left me in a difficult and frustrating position. The promise that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. It saddens me to have to write that, and I maintain total respect for the club and its fans.\n\"I want to make it clear that I have not acted unprofessionally, nor do I wish to leave Brentford on bad terms. I have been transparent in my position throughout. I have continued to communicate openly with the club and conduct myself in a way that reflects my values as both a footballer and a human being.\n\"I remain hopeful that a fair and reasonable resolution can still be found before the transfer window shuts.\n\"In the meantime, I must do what I feel is right for my career and family and insist that Brentford honour their promise to let me join a new club and at a fair price.\n\"I want to thank all the Brentford fans for their support and understanding during this difficult situation. Your energy and belief in me has always meant a great deal. This has never been about walking away from what is a fantastic football club. It's about being allowed to move forward with Brentford's blessing based on repeated promises that I could leave for a new chapter this summer.\n\"Being made to stay beyond this summer will only tarnish four wonderful years at this incredible club and so I ask Brentford's owners and directors to now honour their promise to let me leave in the final hours of the window.\"\n\nA potential move for Wissa to Newcastle could open the door for Liverpool to make a British-record bid for Toon striker Alexander Isak .\nNewcastle's club-record signing of Nick Woltemade has already increased the likelihood of Isak leaving for Liverpool before the window closes.\nNewcastle have maintained that Isak would only be sold if an adequate replacement was found, and that now appears to be the case.\nHowever, Newcastle will attempt to bring in a second striker before listening to offers from Liverpool, and they have been trying to sign Wissa.\nLiverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid rejected for Isak earlier in the summer, so they will have to increase their offer to reach an agreement with Newcastle.\nSky Sports News' Lyall Thomas:\nBrentford have been willing to engage with Newcastle, but his valuation must be met, and they want to replace him.\nThe Bees are yet to sign a replacement - Dango Ouattara was the replacement for Bryan Mbeumo.\nThey tried for Max Beier but were unable to agree a fee with Borussia Dortmund.\nThey will continue to work hard in the market and are assessing other targets with less than 48 hours to go.\nBrentford have rejected two bids from Newcastle for Wissa so far this summer; one worth £25m and the second worth £40m.",
